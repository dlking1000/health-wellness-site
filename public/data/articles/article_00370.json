Iron is indispensable for producing hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Adequate iron levels are crucial for energy, cognitive function, and preventing anemia.\n*   **Selenium:** A powerful antioxidant mineral that plays a critical role in thyroid hormone metabolism, DNA synthesis, and protecting the body from damage caused by free radicals. It also supports immune function.\n*   **Zinc:** Essential for immune system function, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division. It also plays a role in taste and smell perception.\n*   **Copper:** Vital for iron metabolism, energy production, connective tissue formation, and the function of the nervous system.\n*   **Phosphorus:** The second most abundant mineral in the body, phosphorus is crucial for bone and teeth health, energy storage and use, and kidney function.\n\nThese minerals collectively contribute to robust immune responses, efficient energy utilization, and the structural integrity of various bodily tissues.\n\n### How do cow kidneys contribute to energy levels and metabolic health?\n\nThe synergistic combination of B vitamins and highly bioavailable iron found in cow kidneys makes them an exceptional food for supporting energy levels and metabolic health. B vitamins are coenzymes in nearly all metabolic processes, particularly those involved in converting carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy. Without sufficient B vitamins, the body's energy production pathways can become sluggish, leading to fatigue and reduced vitality. Iron, as discussed, is critical for oxygen transport, which is fundamental to cellular respiration and energy generation. By providing these essential nutrients, cow kidneys help optimize the body's metabolic efficiency, ensuring cells have the necessary components to produce energy effectively. This can translate to improved stamina, reduced fatigue, and enhanced overall physical and mental performance.\n\n### Can cow kidneys support immune system function and antioxidant defense?\n\nYes, the nutrient profile of cow kidneys strongly supports both immune system function and the body's natural antioxidant defenses.
