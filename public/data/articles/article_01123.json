For men, certain vitamins and minerals play a crucial role in supporting energy levels, muscle function, heart health, and overall well-being. But with so many options available, it can be challenging to determine which vitamins are truly essential.\n\nThis comprehensive guide answers the most common questions about the **vitamins every man should take**, helping you make informed decisions about your health.\n\n---\n\n### **Q: Why Do Men Need Different Vitamins Than Women?**\n\n**A:** While many vitamins are essential for both men and women, biological differences mean that men often require higher amounts of certain nutrients.
