Below are frequently asked questions to help you understand diabetes management better.\n\n### What is Diabetes?\n\nDiabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. It occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. There are two primary types of diabetes:\n\n- **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections.\n  \n- **Type 2 Diabetes**: More common than type 1, this type occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin. It is often associated with obesity and can be managed with lifestyle changes, medication, or insulin.\n\n### What Are the Symptoms of Diabetes?\n\nCommon symptoms of diabetes include:\n\n- Increased thirst and frequent urination\n- Extreme fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Slow healing of cuts and sores\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Increased hunger\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.\n\n### How is Diabetes Diagnosed?\n\nDiabetes can be diagnosed through several blood tests, including:\n\n- **Fasting Blood Sugar Test**: Measures blood sugar levels after an overnight fast.\n  \n- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test**: Involves fasting overnight and then drinking a sugary solution, with blood sugar levels tested at intervals.\n  \n- **A1C Test**: Measures average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months.
