Maintaining kidney health means ensuring these functions operate effectively and preventing diseases that can compromise proper kidney function.\n\n### Factors Affecting Kidney Health\n\nSeveral factors can influence kidney health, including:\n\n- **Diet**: High-sodium and high-protein diets can place extra strain on the kidneys.\n- **Hydration**: Insufficient water intake can lead to dehydration and kidney stones.\n- **Blood Pressure**: Hypertension can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time.\n- **Diabetes**: Persistent high blood sugar levels can harm kidney tissues.\n- **Genetics**: Family history can play a role in kidney disease susceptibility.\n\n### 1.
