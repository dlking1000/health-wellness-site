Let's take a closer look at what a day might look like for someone navigating depression.\n\n### Morning Routine\n\nSara wakes up feeling heavy and lethargic, which is a common symptom of depression according to the DSM-5. The manual lists \"depressed mood\" as one of the key criteria for a major depressive episode. As she lies in bed, she notices a lack of interest in her usual morning routine, another symptom described in the DSM-5.\n\nSummoning her strength, Sara forces herself to get up and prepare for the day. She skips her usual workout, as the DSM-5 notes that people with depression often experience a \"significant weight loss or gain\" or \"decrease in appetite.\" Instead, she opts for a simple breakfast, but even that feels like a chore.\n\n### Workday Challenges\n\nSara arrives at her office, but focusing on her tasks proves to be a struggle. The DSM-5 outlines \"diminished ability to think or concentrate\" as a common symptom of depression. She finds herself staring at her computer screen, unable to make meaningful progress on her projects.\n\nLunchtime comes and goes, and Sara realizes she hasn't eaten since breakfast. The DSM-5 indicates that a \"loss of interest in most activities\" is another hallmark of depression. She decides to step outside for a brief walk, but even that feels like a monumental effort.\n\n### Afternoon Slump\n\nAs the day wears on, Sara's mood only seems to worsen. She becomes increasingly irritable and snaps at a colleague during a meeting, which aligns with the DSM-5's description of \"irritable mood\" as a potential symptom of depression.\n\nSara's thoughts also begin to spiral, and she finds herself dwelling on feelings of worthlessness and guilt, as the DSM-5 notes is common in depression. She feels overwhelmed by the simplest tasks and finds it difficult to make decisions, another issue outlined in the manual.\n\n### Evening Reflection\n\nBy the time Sara arrives home, she is emotionally and physically drained. The DSM-5 states that people with depression often experience \"fatigue or loss of energy\" throughout the day. She skips preparing a meal and opts for a frozen TV dinner instead, as the manual indicates a \"significant weight loss or gain\" is a possible symptom.\n\nAs Sara sits on the couch, she reflects on her day and the struggles she faced. She feels guilty for not being more productive and wonders if she's letting her team down at work. The DSM-5 highlights \"feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt\" as common in depression.\n\n### Seeking Support\n\nSara knows that she needs to take steps to address her depression, as the DSM-5 outlines the importance of seeking professional help for this condition.
