In this 30-day challenge, we'll guide you through a progressive program to help you understand and manage your cholesterol levels, including exploring options like cholesterol pills names and lifestyle changes.\n\n### Understanding Cholesterol\nBefore we dive into the challenge, it's essential to understand what cholesterol is and how it affects your body. Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood, and it's necessary for various bodily functions. However, high levels of cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. There are two types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \"bad\" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or \"good\" cholesterol.\n\n## Week 1: Setting the Foundation\nIn the first week of our challenge, we'll focus on setting the foundation for a healthier lifestyle. This includes:\n- Making dietary changes: Focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n- Increasing physical activity: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day.\n- Monitoring your cholesterol levels: Schedule a check-up with your healthcare provider to get your cholesterol levels checked.\n\nMany people find additional support helpful.
