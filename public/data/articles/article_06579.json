Manage Stress\n\n- **Practice Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga can help reduce stress levels and improve your energy levels.\n- **Seek Professional Help**: If you are struggling with anxiety or depression, consider speaking to a mental health professional.\n\n#### 5. Stay Organized\n\n- **Prioritize Tasks**: Make a to-do list and prioritize tasks based on importance. This can help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.\n- **Take Breaks**: Allow yourself short breaks throughout the day to recharge.\n\n### When Should I Consult a Healthcare Provider?\n\nIf you experience persistent fatigue that does not improve with lifestyle changes, it is essential to consult a healthcare provider.
