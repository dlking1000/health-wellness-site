While these terms are often used interchangeably, they refer to different aspects of our overall well-being. Brain health focuses on the physical condition of the brain and its ability to function, while mental health encompasses emotional and psychological well-being. This 30-day challenge is designed to help you improve both brain health and mental health, enhancing your overall quality of life.\n\n### Week 1: Nourish Your Brain and Mind\n\n#### Day 1: Understand the Difference\nBefore diving into actionable steps, take a moment to educate yourself about the key differences between brain health and mental health. Brain health is about cognitive function, while mental health deals with emotions and behavior.\n\n#### Day 2: Brain-Boosting Foods\nIncorporating brain-boosting foods into your diet can significantly affect both brain and mental health. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins are beneficial.
