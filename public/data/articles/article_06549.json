However, individual needs may vary based on factors such as age, weight, activity level, and climate. It is best to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate amount of fluid intake for your specific needs.\n\n### Can Kidney Health Drinks Help with Existing Kidney Conditions?\n\nWhile kidney health drinks can support overall kidney function, they should not replace medical treatment for existing kidney conditions.
