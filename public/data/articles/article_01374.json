As the sun set and the world drifted into slumber, you found yourself caught in a never-ending cycle of restlessness and unpredictability. Sleep, the very foundation of your well-being, had become an elusive and often terrifying experience.\n\nYou were a sleepwalker, a condition that had plagued you for years, leaving you and your loved ones in a state of constant worry and uncertainty. Your nocturnal wanderings were a source of endless frustration, as you would wake up in unfamiliar places, sometimes even outside your home, with no recollection of how you got there.\n\nThe impact on your daily life was profound. Fatigue and brain fog were your constant companions, making it difficult to focus at work or engage fully with your family and friends. The fear of potentially harming yourself or others during your sleep episodes only added to the emotional turmoil you faced.\n\n### The Turning Point: Seeking a Solution\n\nOne night, as you found yourself in yet another unfamiliar setting, something inside you shifted.
