Protecting kidney health is essential for long-term wellbeing and preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD). This **30-day challenge** guides you through practical steps and lifestyle habits to boost your kidney health effectively.\n\n---\n\n### Week 1: Nourish Your Kidneys with Kidney-Friendly Foods\n\nWhat you eat can powerfully influence your kidney health.

By following this 30-day challenge, you build habits that support kidney function, reduce risks of CKD, and enhance your overall well-being.
