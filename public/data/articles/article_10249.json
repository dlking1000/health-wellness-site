He learned that investments require patience and constant adaptation. For example, he noted how geopolitical issues could suddenly influence oil prices and how innovations in battery storage could dramatically shift the landscape for renewable energy stocks.\n\n#### Actionable Tip: Stay Educated\n\nAlex subscribed to finance podcasts, read books, and attended webinars on sustainable investments.
