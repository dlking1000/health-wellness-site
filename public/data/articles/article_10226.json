You can also make a smoothie with milk, fruits, and spinach for a nutritious breakfast option.\n- **Cooking**: Use milk as a base for sauces and soups.

Aim for 2\u20133 cups of dairy or its alternatives daily, depending on your age and dietary needs.\n\n#### 5. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**\nIf you're unsure which type of milk is best for you, or if you have specific dietary restrictions, consider consulting a nutritionist or healthcare provider.
