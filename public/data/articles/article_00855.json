It's a natural reaction that helps us respond to situations that require us to adapt or change. When we experience stress, our body's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, releasing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones prepare our body to either fight the threat or flee from it.\n\nStress can be acute or chronic. Acute stress is short-term and usually resolves once the threat has passed. Chronic stress, on the other hand, is long-term and can have serious consequences on our health.\n\n### What is Distress?\n\nDistress is a more severe and prolonged form of stress that can lead to feelings of hopelessness, despair, and anxiety. It's often characterized by a sense of being overwhelmed, helpless, and unable to cope with the demands of daily life. Distress can be triggered by traumatic events, chronic stress, or underlying mental health conditions.\n\n### What's the Difference Between Stress and Distress?\n\nThe key difference between stress and distress is the level of intensity and duration. Stress is a normal response to a perceived threat, while distress is a more severe and prolonged reaction that can have serious consequences on our mental and physical health.\n\nHere are some common signs that you may be experiencing distress:\n\n* Feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope\n* Persistent feelings of anxiety, fear, or sadness\n* Difficulty sleeping or concentrating\n* Changes in appetite or weight\n* Withdrawal from social activities or relationships\n* Feeling hopeless or helpless\n\n### How to Manage Stress and Distress\n\nManaging stress and distress requires a combination of self-care strategies, lifestyle changes, and professional help when needed. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n### Self-Care Strategies\n\n* Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to reduce stress and anxiety\n* Engage in physical activity, such as walking or exercise, to release endorphins and improve mood\n* Get enough sleep (7-8 hours) each night to help regulate stress hormones\n* Connect with friends and family to build a support network\n* Take breaks and prioritize self-care activities, such as reading or taking a relaxing bath\n\n### Lifestyle Changes\n\n* Identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to stress and distress\n* Set realistic goals and priorities to reduce feelings of overwhelm\n* Learn to say \"no\" to commitments that drain your energy\n* Practice gratitude and focus on the positive aspects of your life\n* Consider keeping a journal to track your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors\n\n### Professional Help\n\n* Consult with a healthcare provider if you're experiencing chronic stress or distress\n* Consider seeking therapy or counseling to develop coping strategies and address underlying mental health conditions\n* Join a support group to connect with others who are experiencing similar challenges\n\n### Additional Support\n\nMany people find that weight management supplements can be helpful.
