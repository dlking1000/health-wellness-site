In Virginia, numerous facilities cater to individuals seeking help for mental health issues. To shed light on this vital topic, we interviewed Dr. Sarah Thompson, a licensed clinical psychologist with over 15 years of experience in mental health care. Dr. Thompson has worked in various mental health facilities across Virginia and is passionate about helping individuals navigate their mental health journeys.\n\n### The Importance of Mental Health Facilities\n\n**Interviewer**: Dr. Thompson, can you explain the role of mental health facilities in Virginia?\n\n**Dr. Thompson**: Absolutely.
