Her days were filled with the hustle and bustle of office life, and her nights were often restless. Despite her best efforts to wind down, the sounds of the city\u2014honking horns, distant sirens, and the chatter of late-night revelers\u2014would creep into her dreams, shattering any hope of restorative sleep. \n\nMia longed for tranquility. She had tried everything, from herbal teas to meditation apps, but nothing seemed to work. It was during one particularly sleepless night that she stumbled upon an article about sleep ear plugs.
