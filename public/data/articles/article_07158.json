At thirty-five, she was vibrant and full of life, a dedicated mother of two and an avid runner. But recently, a shadow had crept over her joy. Each morning, she felt a nagging pain in her joints that made her daily runs feel more like a battle than a breath of fresh air.\n\nAs the weeks passed, the pain intensified. It was more than just a physical ache; it was a mental burden that left her feeling drained and frustrated.
