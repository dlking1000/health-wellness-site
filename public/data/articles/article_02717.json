It's responsible for filtering toxins, regulating hormones, metabolizing fats and carbohydrates, and even producing bile for digestion. Yet, despite its critical role, the liver is often neglected or overlooked when it comes to maintaining overall wellness.\n\nMany people are unaware that an unhealthy liver can contribute to a wide range of troubling symptoms, from chronic fatigue and brain fog to skin problems and unexplained weight fluctuations.
