Many people face challenges when it comes to maintaining healthy, beautiful nails. Unfortunately, there are a lot of misconceptions and myths surrounding nail care that can do more harm than good.\n\nIn this article, we're separating fact from fiction and debunking 7 of the most common nail care myths. We've even included some stunning nail photos from local Jacksonville, FL salons to give you a glimpse of what's possible with proper nail care.\n\n## Myth 1: Filing Your Nails Too Often Damages Them\n\n### The Truth: Proper Filing Technique is Key\n\nOne of the most persistent myths about nail care is that filing your nails too often will weaken and damage them over time. While it's true that aggressive, improper filing can be harmful, regular gentle filing is actually beneficial for nail health.\n\nThe key is to use a high-quality nail file and to file in one direction, rather than sawing back and forth. This helps smooth the nail edges without tearing or splitting the nail plate. Many nail experts recommend filing just once a week to maintain a neat, even shape.\n\nCheck out these beautifully filed and shaped nails from Nail Creations in Jacksonville:\n\n![Nails filed and shaped at Nail Creations in Jacksonville, FL](https://i.imgur.com/XYXTLJj.jpg)\n\n## Myth 2: Nail Polish Ruins Nails\n\n### The Facts: Proper Polish Removal is Key\n\nAnother common myth is that wearing nail polish, especially dark colors, will stain or damage the nails. While it's true that certain polishes can cause issues if not removed properly, the nail polish itself isn't the problem.\n\nThe real culprit is the acetone-based polish removers that can be drying and damaging to nails. Instead, opt for an acetone-free remover or try soaking nails in warm, soapy water to gently remove polish. And be sure to give your nails regular \"polish breaks\" to allow them to breathe.\n\nHere's an example of beautiful, healthy nails at Nail Artistry in Jacksonville, FL:\n\n![Healthy, well-manicured nails at Nail Artistry in Jacksonville, FL](https://i.imgur.com/wbEE1UT.jpg)\n\n## Myth 3: Cutting Cuticles is Necessary for Nail Health\n\n### The Truth: Cuticle Care is Important, But Cutting Isn't Required\n\nMany people believe that cutting or removing the cuticles is an essential part of nail care. However, this is actually a myth. Cuticles play an important role in protecting the nail bed from bacteria and infection, so it's best to avoid cutting them.\n\nInstead, focus on gently pushing back the cuticles and using a cuticle cream or oil to keep them soft and healthy. This will help prevent hangnails and keep your nails looking their best.

However, the reality is that there are a variety of potential causes for yellow or discolored nails, including:\n\n- Fungal infections\n- Certain medications\n- Underlying health conditions\n- Exposure to chemicals or dyes\n\nIf you're dealing with persistent nail discoloration, it's important to see a dermatologist or podiatrist to determine the underlying cause and get appropriate treatment. Don't just assume it's from nail polish!\n\n## Myth 5: Nail Growth is Entirely Genetic\n\n### The Truth: Lifestyle Factors Play a Big Role\n\nIt's a common belief that nail growth is primarily determined by genetics, and that there's not much you can do to influence it. However, this is not entirely accurate. While genetics do play a role, there are many lifestyle factors that can impact nail growth and health, including:\n\n- Diet and nutrition\n- Hydration levels\n- Stress levels\n- Exposure to chemicals or harsh environments\n- Nail care habits\n\nBy focusing on these areas and making healthy choices, you can help support and optimize your nail growth and strength.

Many people believe that gel polish is inherently damaging to the nails, but this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nThe key is to ensure that the gel polish is properly removed, either by soaking in acetone or using a professional gel removal service. Attempting to peel or pick off the gel can cause significant damage to the nail plate. When done correctly, gel manicures can actually help strengthen and protect the nails.\n\nHere's an example of beautifully applied and maintained gel nails from Nail Boutique in Jacksonville:\n\n![Gel manicure at Nail Boutique in Jacksonville, FL](https://i.imgur.com/YV9Ggjz.jpg)\n\n## Myth 7: Nail Supplements Don't Work\n\n### The Truth: Quality Supplements Can Support Nail Health\n\nFinally, there's a common myth that nail supplements, such as vitamins and minerals, don't actually do anything to improve nail health and appearance. While it's true that some supplements may not be effective, there are quality nail health supplements that can make a real difference.\n\nMany people find that nail health supplements containing biotin, silica, and other key nutrients can help strengthen nails, promote growth, and reduce brittleness and discoloration.
