Here are some common approaches:\n\n#### 1. Rest and Ice\n\nTaking time off from activities that aggravate the knee and applying ice can help reduce swelling and pain.\n\n#### 2. Compression and Elevation\n\nUsing a compression bandage and elevating the knee can further alleviate swelling.\n\n#### 3. Medication\n\nOver-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can provide relief from pain and inflammation. In some cases, doctors may prescribe stronger medications or corticosteroid injections.\n\n#### 4. Physical Therapy\n\nA physical therapist can design a personalized exercise program to strengthen the knee and improve flexibility, which can help reduce inflammation over time.\n\n#### 5. Lifestyle Changes\n\nMaintaining a healthy weight can relieve pressure on the knees.
