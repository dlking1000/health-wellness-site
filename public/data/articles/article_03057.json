Some of the most common causes of fatigue include:\n\n1. **Sleep Deprivation**: Inadequate sleep or poor sleep quality can lead to persistent fatigue and lack of energy.\n\n2. **Stress and Anxiety**: High levels of stress and anxiety can take a toll on your physical and mental well-being, contributing to feelings of tiredness.\n\n3. **Anemia**: Anemia, a condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin, can result in fatigue and weakness.\n\n4. **Thyroid Disorders**: Imbalances in thyroid hormone production, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, can cause fatigue.\n\n5. **Dehydration**: Not drinking enough water can lead to dehydration, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue.\n\n6. **Sedentary Lifestyle**: A lack of physical activity and a predominantly sedentary lifestyle can lead to decreased energy levels.\n\n7. **Chronic Illnesses**: Conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and chronic infections can cause persistent fatigue.\n\n### What are the most common causes of yellow eyes?\n\nYellow eyes, also known as jaundice, can have several potential causes. Some of the most common include:\n\n1. **Liver Dysfunction**: Conditions that affect the liver, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer, can lead to the buildup of bilirubin, causing yellow eyes.\n\n2. **Gallbladder Issues**: Problems with the gallbladder, such as gallstones or gallbladder inflammation, can lead to yellow eyes.\n\n3. **Red Blood Cell Breakdown**: Rapid breakdown of red blood cells, known as hemolysis, can result in the accumulation of bilirubin and yellow eyes.\n\n4. **Bile Duct Blockage**: Blockages or obstructions in the bile ducts can prevent the proper flow of bile, leading to the accumulation of bilirubin and yellow eyes.\n\n5. **Newborn Jaundice**: Newborns often experience a temporary form of jaundice due to the immaturity of their liver and the breakdown of red blood cells.\n\n6. **Certain Medications**: Some medications, such as certain antibiotics or antidepressants, can cause yellow eyes as a side effect.\n\n7. **Malnutrition**: Severe malnutrition, particularly a lack of certain vitamins and minerals, can contribute to the development of yellow eyes.\n\n### When should you see a healthcare provider for fatigue and yellow eyes?\n\nIt's important to seek medical attention if you experience persistent or severe fatigue and yellow eyes, as these symptoms may indicate an underlying health condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.

They can conduct the necessary tests, provide a comprehensive evaluation, and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\n### How can you address fatigue and yellow eyes?\n\nAddressing fatigue and yellow eyes often involves a multifaceted approach that considers the underlying cause.
