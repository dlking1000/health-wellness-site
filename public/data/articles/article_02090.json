Type 1 Diabetes: An autoimmune condition where the body doesn't produce enough insulin.\n2. Type 2 Diabetes: A condition in which the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough.\n\nBoth types of diabetes can lead to severe complications if left untreated, including heart disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, and vision loss.\n\n",
