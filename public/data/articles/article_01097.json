You're not alone. Millions of people around the world struggle with depression and anxiety, two mental health conditions that can be overwhelming and debilitating. But there is hope. By understanding the differences between depression and anxiety, and learning effective strategies to manage them, you can break free from the shadows and start living the life you deserve.\n\n### The Weight of Depression and Anxiety\n\nDepression and anxiety are two of the most common mental health conditions, affecting over 300 million people worldwide.

Depression is characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities. Anxiety, on the other hand, is marked by excessive worry, fear, and anxiety.\n\n### Understanding the Causes\n\nSo, what causes depression and anxiety?
