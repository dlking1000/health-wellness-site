One area that has gained attention in recent years is gut health, which plays a crucial role in overall wellness. A key player in maintaining gut health is probiotics. In this article, we will explore what probiotics are, their benefits for kids, and how you can incorporate them into your child's diet through a fun and engaging 30-day challenge.\n\n### What Are Probiotics?\n\nProbiotics are live microorganisms, often referred to as \"good bacteria,\" that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts.
