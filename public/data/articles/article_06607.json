The liver plays a critical role in digestion, detoxification, and metabolism. For many, improving liver health can seem overwhelming, but it can be simplified through dietary changes. This 30-day challenge is designed to introduce liver health improvement foods into your daily routine, making it easier to incorporate better choices into your diet.\n\n### Understanding Liver Health\n\nBefore diving into the challenge, it's important to understand what liver health means. The liver is responsible for filtering toxins, producing bile for digestion, and storing nutrients. A healthy liver can help prevent various diseases, including fatty liver disease and liver cirrhosis. Factors such as a poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise can negatively impact liver health.\n\n### The 30-Day Challenge Overview\n\nThis challenge consists of daily tasks and food recommendations that focus on liver health improvement. Each week will have a specific theme, with foods and practices to focus on. By the end of the 30 days, you should feel more energized and in tune with your body's needs.\n\n### Week 1: Hydration and Detoxification\n\n#### Day 1: Start with Water\n\nStart your day with a glass of warm water with lemon.
