The primary focus is on:\n\n- **Healthy Fats**: Avocados, nuts, and olive oil.\n- **Low-Carbohydrate Vegetables**: Such as leafy greens.\n- **Moderate Protein**: While still maintaining ketosis.\n\n**Pros**:\n- Can lead to reduced inflammation, which can benefit skin conditions.\n- May help with blood sugar control, reducing the risk of acne.\n\n**Cons**:\n- The initial phase can lead to \"keto flu,\" which may include skin breakouts.\n- Long-term adherence may be challenging and can lead to nutrient deficiencies.\n\n### Comparing the Diets\n\nAfter examining each diet, it's clear that they each offer unique benefits for skin health.
