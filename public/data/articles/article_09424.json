These options typically contain a blend of herbal ingredients, vitamins, and minerals known for their calming properties. \n\nSome popular natural sleeping pills include:\n\n- Melatonin\n- Valerian root\n- Chamomile\n- Passionflower\n- Lavender\n- GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)\n\nEach of these ingredients serves a unique purpose in promoting sleep. By understanding their benefits, you can identify which natural sleeping pill may be best for you.\n\n### The Ingredients: A Closer Look\n\n#### Melatonin\n\nMelatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in response to darkness.
