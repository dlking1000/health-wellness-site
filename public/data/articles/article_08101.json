The kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste products, balancing fluids, and regulating blood pressure. Engaging in a 30-day challenge can be an excellent way to improve your kidney health while also adopting healthier habits that benefit your entire body. This guide will provide daily activities, dietary suggestions, and lifestyle changes to support your kidney health.\n\n### Week 1: Understanding Your Kidneys\n\n#### Day 1: Learn About Kidney Function\nBegin your challenge by educating yourself about the kidneys. Understand their role in filtering blood, producing urine, and regulating essential minerals.\n\n#### Day 2: Hydration Awareness\nWater is essential for kidney health. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water daily. Use this day to track your hydration levels.\n\n#### Day 3: Dietary Choices\nFocus on a balanced diet.
