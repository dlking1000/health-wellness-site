Many individuals may not realize the extent of the problem, which can affect both physical and mental well-being. This 30-day challenge aims to help you break the habit of nail biting while also educating you about the health risks associated with this behavior. \n\n### Understanding Nail Biting\n\nNail biting is often a response to stress, anxiety, boredom, or even concentration. While it may seem harmless, nail biting can lead to several health issues, including:\n\n- **Infections**: Biting nails can introduce bacteria and fungi into the nail bed, leading to infections.\n- **Dental Problems**: Chronic nail biting can affect your teeth by causing misalignment or damage.\n- **Skin Damage**: The skin around the nails can become irritated or infected due to frequent biting.\n- **Nail Abnormalities**: Habitual biting can lead to misshapen or unhealthy nails.\n\nUnderstanding these risks is the first step toward breaking the habit. \n\n### Week 1: Awareness and Preparation\n\n#### Day 1: Identify Triggers\n\nBegin by keeping a journal to identify when and why you bite your nails.
