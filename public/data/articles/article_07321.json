However, understanding cholesterol and taking proactive steps can significantly improve your heart health. This 30-day cholesterol challenge is designed to guide you through making lifestyle changes that can help manage your cholesterol levels effectively. \n\n### What Is Cholesterol?\n\nCholesterol is a waxy substance found in your blood. Your body needs some cholesterol to build healthy cells, but high levels of cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. Cholesterol travels through your bloodstream in two types of lipoproteins:\n\n- **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)**: Often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, high levels of LDL can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n- **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)**: Known as \"good\" cholesterol, HDL helps carry cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it is processed and removed from the body.\n\n### Why Is Managing Cholesterol Important?\n\nManaging cholesterol is crucial for maintaining heart health. Elevated cholesterol levels can lead to:\n\n- Atherosclerosis: Hardening and narrowing of the arteries.\n- Heart Attacks: Blockage of blood flow to the heart.\n- Strokes: Blockage of blood flow to the brain.\n\nBy taking steps to manage your cholesterol through diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes, you can significantly reduce your risk of these serious conditions.\n\n### Your 30-Day Cholesterol Challenge\n\nThis challenge consists of daily tasks and tips designed to help you lower your cholesterol levels and improve your overall heart health. \n\n#### Week 1: Assess and Educate\n\n**Day 1: Know Your Numbers**\n- Schedule a cholesterol screening with your healthcare provider.
