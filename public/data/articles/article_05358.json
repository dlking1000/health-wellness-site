Subway, known for its fresh ingredients and customizable sandwiches, can be a great option for those seeking healthier meal choices. This guide will help you understand what is heart healthy at Subway, ensuring you can make informed decisions while enjoying your meal.\n\n### Understanding Heart Health\n\nBefore diving into Subway's menu, it's important to understand the key components of a heart-healthy diet. Heart health mainly revolves around:\n\n- **Healthy Fats**: Opt for unsaturated fats found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil while limiting saturated and trans fats.\n- **Whole Grains**: Choose whole grains over refined grains to increase fiber intake and lower cholesterol levels.\n- **Fruits and Vegetables**: Aiming for a variety of colors in your diet ensures you get a range of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.\n- **Lean Proteins**: Select lean sources of protein such as poultry, fish, beans, and legumes.\n- **Low Sodium**: Reducing sodium intake can help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nWith these principles in mind, let\u2019s explore the heart-healthy options available at Subway.\n\n### Sandwiches\n\nSubway offers a wide variety of sandwiches, and when crafted thoughtfully, they can be both delicious and heart-healthy.\n\n#### 1. Choose Whole Wheat Bread\n\nStart with whole wheat or whole grain bread instead of white bread. Whole wheat bread is higher in fiber, which can help lower cholesterol levels and improve heart health.\n\n#### 2. Lean Proteins\n\nOpt for lean proteins like turkey breast, chicken breast, or veggie patties. These options are lower in saturated fat compared to other meats. For example, a Turkey Breast sandwich can provide a satisfying meal without overwhelming your heart with unhealthy fats.\n\n#### 3. Load Up on Vegetables\n\nSubway allows you to customize your sandwich with a plethora of fresh vegetables. Load up on spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers to add fiber and essential nutrients. These not only enhance the flavor but also boost the nutritional profile of your meal.\n\n#### 4. Sauce and Dressing Choices\n\nBe cautious with sauces and dressings, as many can be high in calories and sodium. Opt for mustard or vinegar-based dressings, which are generally healthier than creamy sauces. Always ask for sauces on the side to control how much you use.\n\n### Salads\n\nIf you're looking for a lighter option, Subway's salads can be a fantastic choice.\n\n#### 1. Base Selection\n\nStart with a base of leafy greens such as spinach or romaine. These greens are low in calories and packed with nutrients vital for heart health.\n\n#### 2. Protein Choices\n\nAdd grilled chicken or turkey for lean protein. Avoid fried options like crispy chicken, which can add unnecessary calories and unhealthy fats.\n\n#### 3. Toppings\n\nInclude a variety of vegetables to enhance the flavor and nutrition of your salad. Be mindful of high-calorie toppings such as cheese and croutons. Instead, consider adding beans or chickpeas for an additional protein boost without excessive calories.\n\n#### 4. Dressing Wisely\n\nJust like with sandwiches, dressings can make or break a salad. Choose lighter options like balsamic vinegar or a small amount of olive oil for a heart-healthy choice.\n\n### Wraps\n\nSubway\u2019s wraps can also be a healthy alternative to sandwiches.\n\n#### 1. Whole Grain Wraps\n\nChoose whole grain wraps to increase your fiber intake. This choice aligns with the goal of reducing heart disease risk.\n\n#### 2. Fillings and Proteins\n\nSimilar to sandwiches, opt for lean proteins and load up on vegetables. Incorporating a variety of colors in your wrap can boost the meal's nutritional value.\n\n### Sides and Snacks\n\nWhen it comes to sides, Subway offers several healthier options.\n\n#### 1. Apple Slices\n\nApple slices are a great alternative to chips or cookies. They provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals without added sugars or unhealthy fats.\n\n#### 2. Yogurt\n\nLow-fat yogurt is another heart-healthy snack option available at some Subway locations. It can provide protein and calcium without the high fat content of some other snacks.\n\n### Drinks\n\nBeverages can be a hidden source of calories and sugars, so it is wise to choose wisely.\n\n#### 1. Water\n\nWater should always be your first choice. Staying hydrated is crucial for overall health, and it contains no calories.\n\n#### 2. Unsweetened Iced Tea\n\nIf you're looking for something with flavor, unsweetened iced tea can be a refreshing option without added sugars.\n\n### Nutritional Information\n\nSubway provides nutritional information on its website and in-store, making it easier to understand the contents of your meal. Be sure to review this information to make heart-healthy decisions.\n\n### Tips for Dining at Subway\n\n1. **Customize**: Don\u2019t hesitate to customize your order. Subway's philosophy is built around personalization, so take advantage of it.\n2. **Watch Portion Sizes**: Consider ordering a smaller sandwich or salad if you're not very hungry.\n3. **Balance Your Meal**: Pair your sandwich with a side of fruit or a small salad to create a balanced meal.\n4. **Plan Ahead**: If you know you will be dining at Subway, check their menu online and decide on your order beforehand.\n\n### Additional Health Considerations\n\nWhile focusing on heart health is essential, consider other aspects of wellness, such as brain health.
