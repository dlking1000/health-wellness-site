The gentle exercise and change of scenery help to distract her from the discomfort and improve her mood.\n\nWhen lunchtime rolls around, Samantha is careful to choose foods that can help alleviate her headache. She opts for a leafy green salad with avocado, which provides anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, and a side of mixed berries, which are rich in antioxidants.

She's learned that using both hot and cold therapy can be an effective way to manage stress headaches, depending on the individual's preferences and needs.\n\n### Evening Unwinding and Preparation for Tomorrow\n\nAs the workday comes to an end, Samantha knows she needs to prioritize self-care and relaxation to ensure a restful night's sleep. She starts by dimming the lights and turning off any screens, as the blue light can exacerbate headaches. She then enjoys a warm, soothing cup of herbal tea, such as chamomile or ginger, which can help to further calm her mind and body.\n\nBefore bed, Samantha takes a few minutes to journal, reflecting on the day and identifying any triggers or patterns that may be contributing to her stress headaches.
