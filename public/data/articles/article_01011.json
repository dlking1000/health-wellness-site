This reduces the risk of temporary bloating or gas.\n\n#### **Step 3: Pair with Prebiotic Foods**\nProbiotics thrive when fed prebiotics\u2014fiber-rich foods like:\n- Garlic, onions, leeks\n- Bananas, apples, berries\n- Oats, flaxseeds, chia seeds\n- Asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes\n\n#### **Step 4: Stay Consistent**\nTake your probiotic extra daily at the same time.
