Start by incorporating the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser, a gentle, non-drying formula that effectively removes impurities and makeup without stripping your skin.\n\n### Phase 2: Hydrating and Balancing (Days 8-14)\n\nIn the second week, you'll focus on restoring your skin's natural balance and replenishing its moisture levels.

Incorporate the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen, a mineral-based formula that offers broad-spectrum protection, and consider adding a nourishing facial oil or serum to your routine.\n\n### Tracking Your Progress\n\nThroughout the challenge, be sure to take before-and-after photos and keep a journal to document your skin's transformation.
