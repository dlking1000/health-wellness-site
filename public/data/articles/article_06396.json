Key organs involved include the stomach, intestines, and liver.\n\n#### Day 2: Identify Your Digestive Issues\n\nTake note of any digestive issues you may be experiencing, such as bloating, gas, or irregular bowel movements. Keeping a journal can help you track symptoms and identify triggers.\n\n#### Day 3: Embrace Fiber-Rich Foods\n\nFiber is essential for digestive health. Start incorporating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes into your diet. Aim for at least 25 grams of fiber per day.\n\n#### Day 4: Stay Hydrated\n\nDrinking enough water aids digestion by helping break down food and absorb nutrients. Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily.\n\n#### Day 5: Introduce Probiotics\n\nProbiotics are beneficial bacteria that support digestive health.
