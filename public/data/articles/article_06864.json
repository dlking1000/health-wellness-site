I encourage a diet rich in whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It's important to minimize processed foods and added sugars. Additionally, hydration is vital; drinking enough water can significantly affect energy levels and cognitive function. Each person's nutritional needs may vary, so we always emphasize individualized dietary plans.\n\n### Mental Health and Its Importance\n\n**Interviewer:** Mental health is increasingly recognized as a vital part of overall wellness.

Regular exercise can help manage weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve mood. We encourage our patients to find activities they enjoy, whether it is walking, yoga, or strength training. What's most important is consistency\u2014making movement a regular part of daily life, tailored to each person's capabilities and preferences.\n\n### Building a Supportive Community\n\n**Interviewer:** Community support can greatly influence individual wellness.
