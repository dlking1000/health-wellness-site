She has worked with countless athletes, from weekend warriors to professional marathoners, and is well-versed in the science of energy gels for running. In this interview, Dr. Simmons shares her insights on the benefits, types, and usage of energy gels for runners.\n\n**Q: To start, can you explain what energy gels are and why they're used in running?**\n\nDr. Simmons: Energy gels are portable, easy-to-consume sources of carbohydrates designed to provide a quick energy boost during endurance activities like running. They're typically consumed before or during a run to help maintain blood sugar levels, delay fatigue, and enhance performance.\n\n**Q: What are the primary ingredients in energy gels, and how do they work?**\n\nDr. Simmons: Energy gels mainly consist of simple and complex carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and maltodextrin. These carbohydrates are quickly absorbed by the body and converted into glucose, which is used as energy by muscles. Some energy gels also contain electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, to help replace those lost through sweat.\n\n**Q: Are there different types of energy gels, and if so, what are the main differences?**\n\nDr. Simmons: Yes, there are several types of energy gels, each with its unique features. Some gels are thicker and require more water for proper digestion, while others are thinner and can be consumed with less water. Additionally, some gels contain caffeine for an added energy boost, while others are caffeine-free. There are also gels designed for specific dietary needs, such as vegan or gluten-free options.\n\n**Q: How should runners determine the right amount of energy gels to consume during a run?**\n\nDr. Simmons: The ideal amount of energy gels depends on various factors, including the runner's body weight, intensity and duration of the run, and personal tolerance. As a general guideline, most runners consume 1-2 energy gels per hour of running. However, it's essential to experiment with different quantities during training to find the right balance and avoid gastrointestinal issues.\n\n**Q: When is the best time to consume energy gels during a run?**\n\nDr. Simmons: Energy gels should ideally be consumed 15-30 minutes before the onset of fatigue or every 30-45 minutes during a run. This timing ensures a consistent supply of energy to the muscles and helps prevent bonking or \"hitting the wall.\"\n\n**Q: Are there any potential downsides or risks associated with using energy gels for running?**\n\nDr. Simmons: Yes, there are some potential downsides to using energy gels. Overconsumption can lead to gastrointestinal distress, such as bloating, cramping, and diarrhea. Additionally, some runners may find that the sticky texture of energy gels is unappealing or difficult to consume during a run. In these cases, alternative energy sources, like energy chews or drinks, may be more suitable.\n\n**Q: Can energy gels be used for other sports or activities, or are they exclusively for running?**\n\nDr. Simmons: Energy gels can be used for various endurance activities, including cycling, swimming, and hiking. They're particularly beneficial for any activity that requires sustained effort and carbohydrate replenishment.\n\n**Q: Lastly, do you have any tips for first-time energy gel users?**\n\nDr. Simmons: Absolutely! My top tip for first-time energy gel users is to practice using them during training sessions before incorporating them into races. This practice allows runners to determine their optimal consumption rate, become accustomed to the texture and taste, and identify any potential gastrointestinal issues.\n\nMany people find that energy gels can be helpful.
