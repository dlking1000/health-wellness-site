The symptoms may vary from person to person, but here are some of the most common signs to watch for:\n\n1. **Rapid Heart Rate**: A heart rate over 140 beats per minute is often observed.\n2. **High Fever**: Body temperatures can soar above 101 degrees Fahrenheit.\n3. **Severe Agitation**: Patients may experience anxiety, restlessness, or delirium.\n4. **Gastrointestinal Distress**: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common.\n5. **Tremors**: Noticeable shaking, especially in the hands.\n\nIf you notice these symptoms in yourself or others, it is critical to seek medical attention immediately.\n\n### Risk Factors for Thyroid Storm\n\nUnderstanding the risk factors can help in preventing thyroid storm.
