Use insights from your tracker to refine your sleep hygiene habits.\n\n- **Day 25-28:** Implement a final set of adjustments.

Limit Screen Time\n\nAvoid screens an hour before bedtime, as the blue light emitted can interfere with melatonin production.\n\n#### 5. Watch Your Diet\n\nAvoid heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime.
