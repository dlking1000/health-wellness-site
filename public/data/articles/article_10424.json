This 30-Day Heart Health Home Care Challenge aims to provide actionable steps you can incorporate into your daily routine. Each day features a specific activity or focus area to help you improve your heart health from the comfort of your home. Let\u2019s get started!\n\n### Week 1: Nutrition for a Healthy Heart\n\n#### Day 1: Assess Your Diet\nBegin with an inventory of your current eating habits. Write down everything you consume today.
