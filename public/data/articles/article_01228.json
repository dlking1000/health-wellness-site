When we encounter stress, our bodies release hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepare us for a \"fight or flight\" response. This response can be helpful in dangerous situations, but chronic stress can have negative effects on the body.\n\nChronic stress can lead to a variety of health problems, including:\n\n* Anxiety and depression\n* Digestive problems\n* Headaches\n* Muscle tension\n* Sleep problems\n* High blood pressure\n* Heart disease\n\n### Benefits of Stress Remedies at Home\n\nManaging stress at home can have numerous benefits for both physical and mental health.
