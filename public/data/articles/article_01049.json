Do you struggle to muster the energy to tackle even the simplest tasks? You're not alone. Many people in high-energy industries like manufacturing and production often find themselves drained, both physically and mentally.\n\n### Validating the Problem: You're Not Alone\n\nFeeling tired all the time can be debilitating. It's not just about lacking the energy to get through the day; it's about the impact it has on your overall well-being. Fatigue can affect your mood, relationships, and even your job performance. It's essential to acknowledge that this is a real problem that requires attention and solutions.\n\n### Understanding the Causes: It's Not Just About Sleep\n\nWhile sleep deprivation is often a significant contributor to fatigue, it's not the only factor.
