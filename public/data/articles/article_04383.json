Understanding the differences between these two categories is crucial for making informed decisions about your health. This article will guide you through a comparison journey that explores the definitions, purposes, benefits, potential risks, and overall impact of supplements and drugs.\n\n### Defining Supplements and Drugs\n\n#### What Are Supplements?\n\nSupplements are products designed to enhance your diet and support overall health. They can come in various forms, including pills, powders, liquids, and gummies. Supplements may contain vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, or other substances intended to promote health, fill dietary gaps, or provide specific health benefits.\n\n#### What Are Drugs?\n\nDrugs, on the other hand, are substances that are used to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent diseases. They are typically synthesized in laboratories and undergo rigorous testing and approval processes by regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be prescribed or sold to the public. Drugs can be prescription-based or available over the counter, depending on their usage and regulation.\n\n### Purposes of Supplements and Drugs\n\n#### The Role of Supplements\n\nSupplements primarily aim to support overall health, improve nutritional status, and enhance well-being. People often take supplements to:\n\n- Fill nutritional gaps in their diet\n- Boost energy levels\n- Support immune function\n- Enhance physical performance\n- Promote digestive health\n\nFor instance, many people find that metabolism and digestive health supplements can be helpful.
