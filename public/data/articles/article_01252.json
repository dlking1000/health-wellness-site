It can lead to various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. While maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise are crucial for weight loss, some individuals may require additional support to achieve their goals. One such support system is weight loss medication, such as Xywav.\n\nXywav is a prescription medication approved by the FDA for treating excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.
