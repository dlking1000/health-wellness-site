It's a more accurate representation of your overall health and wellness than simply looking at your numerical age. Your fitness age can be higher or lower than your chronological age, depending on factors such as your activity level, body composition, and overall cardiovascular health.\n\nDetermining your fitness age can provide valuable insights into your current physical condition and help you set realistic goals for improvement.

Seeing your fitness age decrease can be a significant boost to your morale and drive you to continue on your wellness journey.\n\n### 3. Early Detection of Health Risks\nIf your fitness age is significantly higher than your chronological age, it may indicate an increased risk of health issues such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic conditions.

Focus on activities that elevate your heart rate and challenge your cardiovascular system, such as running, cycling, or swimming. Regularly monitoring your resting heart rate and VO2 max can help you track your progress and identify areas for improvement.\n\n### 3.
