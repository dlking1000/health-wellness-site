Digestive problems, like bloating and irregular bowel movements, had become a constant source of discomfort, and she had even started noticing some troubling skin concerns, like breakouts and dullness.\n\nDespite her best efforts to maintain a balanced diet and exercise routine, Sarah couldn't shake these persistent problems. She felt like she had tried everything, but nothing seemed to provide the relief she so desperately needed.\n\nOne day, while scrolling through her social media feed, Sarah came across a post about the benefits of probiotics for women.
