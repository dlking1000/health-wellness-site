Adopting a kidney healthy diet can significantly impact kidney function and overall well-being. This 30-day challenge is designed to help you incorporate kidney-friendly foods into your daily routine while educating you on the best practices for kidney health.\n\n### Understanding Kidney Health\n\nBefore diving into the challenge, it\u2019s essential to understand the factors that affect kidney health. Chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension can lead to kidney damage. Therefore, a kidney healthy diet is vital for prevention and management.
