Metabolism is the process by which our bodies convert the food we eat into energy. This energy is used to fuel all of our bodily functions, from breathing and digestion to muscle movement and thought processes. A healthy metabolism is essential for maintaining a healthy weight, having enough energy, and preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\n",
