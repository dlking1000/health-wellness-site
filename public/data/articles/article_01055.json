It's often called the \"silent killer\" because it usually has no warning signs or symptoms, and many people don't realize they have it. If left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems such as heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe good news is that high blood pressure can be managed and reduced through lifestyle changes and, when necessary, medication. This 30-day challenge is designed to help you lower your blood pressure readings and improve your overall health.\n\n### Overview\n\nThis 30-day challenge consists of four weeks of progressive steps to lower your blood pressure readings. Each week focuses on a different aspect of your lifestyle, including diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep.

Limit your alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.\n\n### Week 2: Exercise\n\nDuring the second week, you will focus on adding exercise to your daily routine. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Get Moving:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.

Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Create a Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.\n2. **Make Your Sleep Environment Comfortable:** Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.
