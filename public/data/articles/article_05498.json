Lifting Weights Too Heavy\n\nLifting weights that are too heavy can compromise your form and increase the risk of injury. Start light and progressively increase weights.\n\n#### 3. Ignoring Safety Features\n\nMake use of the safety features, such as adjustable safety bars. They are there for your protection and can prevent accidents during heavy lifts.\n\n#### 4.
