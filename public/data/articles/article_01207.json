A standard serving (about 3-4 dates or 24 grams) typically provides:\n\n- **Fiber:** 1.6\u20132 grams (supports digestion and gut health)\n- **Potassium:** 167\u2013200 mg (helps regulate blood pressure and muscle function)\n- **Magnesium:** 12\u201315 mg (supports nerve function and bone health)\n- **Iron:** 0.2\u20130.3 mg (important for red blood cell production)\n- **Vitamin B6:** 0.05\u20130.08 mg (aids metabolism and brain health)\n- **Calcium:** 12\u201315 mg (supports bone strength)\n- **Antioxidants:** Including flavonoids, carotenoids, and phenolic acid (fights oxidative stress)\n\nDates also contain natural sugars like glucose, fructose, and sucrose, making them a quick energy source without the crash associated with refined sugars.\n\n---\n\n### **Q: How do dates compare to other dried fruits in terms of nutrition?**\n\n**A:** Dates stand out among dried fruits due to their high fiber content, mineral density, and lower glycemic index (GI) compared to fruits like raisins or dried apricots. Here\u2019s a quick comparison per 100 grams:\n\n| Nutrient       | Dates       | Raisins      | Dried Apricots | Figs (Dried) |\n|----------------|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|\n| **Calories**   | 282        | 299         | 241           | 249         |\n| **Fiber (g)**  | 6.7        | 3.7         | 7.3           | 9.8         |\n| **Potassium (mg)** | 696   | 749         | 1,162         | 680         |\n| **Iron (mg)**  | 0.9        | 1.9         | 2.7           | 2.0         |\n| **Sugar (g)**  | 66.5       | 59.2        | 53.4          | 47.9        |\n\n**Key Takeaway:** While dates are higher in natural sugars, their fiber content helps slow sugar absorption, making them a balanced choice.
