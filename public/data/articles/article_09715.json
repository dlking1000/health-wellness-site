This article will take you on a comparison journey through various vitamins, highlighting their benefits and how they contribute to overall wellness. By the end, you will have a comprehensive vitamins benefits list that will aid in making informed choices about your health.\n\n### Understanding Vitamins: What They Are and Why They Matter\n\nVitamins are organic compounds that are essential for normal growth and nutrition. They are required by the body in small amounts and must be obtained from food or supplements, as the body either does not produce them or does not produce them in sufficient quantities. There are two main categories of vitamins:\n\n- **Water-Soluble Vitamins**: These include vitamin C and the B vitamins. They dissolve in water and are not stored in the body. Excess amounts are expelled through urine, making regular intake necessary.\n\n- **Fat-Soluble Vitamins**: These include vitamins A, D, E, and K. They are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use.\n\nMany people find additional support helpful.
