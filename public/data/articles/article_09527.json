Having a tidy area will make the process smoother and more enjoyable.\n\n#### Step 2: Combine Dry Ingredients\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats, ground flaxseed, and a pinch of salt. If you are adding any optional dry ingredients, such as mini chocolate chips or dried fruit, include them at this stage. Mix thoroughly.\n\n#### Step 3: Mix Wet Ingredients\n\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the nut butter, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and creamy.\n\n#### Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures\n\nPour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to mix everything until fully incorporated. The mixture should be sticky but manageable. If it seems too dry, add a little more nut butter or honey.\n\n#### Step 5: Form the Energy Balls\n\nOnce the mixture is well combined, use your hands to form small balls, about one inch in diameter. If the mixture is too sticky, dampen your hands with a little water to help shape the balls.\n\n#### Step 6: Refrigerate\n\nPlace the formed energy oat balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow them to firm up. This step is crucial as it helps the balls maintain their shape.\n\n#### Step 7: Store and Enjoy\n\nAfter chilling, transfer the energy oat balls to an airtight container.
