These strains can contribute to improved digestion and overall gut health.\n\n### Are There Specific Probiotic Strains Beneficial for Digestive Health?\n\nCertain probiotic strains are known for their effectiveness in promoting digestive health:\n\n- **Lactobacillus**: This strain is commonly found in yogurt and helps with lactose digestion and may alleviate diarrhea.\n- **Bifidobacterium**: This strain can help reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and improve overall gut function.\n- **Saccharomyces boulardii**: A beneficial yeast that can help combat diarrhea and restore gut flora after antibiotic use.\n\n### How Can I Recognize When to See a Doctor?\n\nIf digestive issues persist despite dietary and lifestyle changes, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider.
