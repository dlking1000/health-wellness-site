While lifestyle changes can help alleviate fatigue, many people turn to natural supplements for additional support. To delve deeper into this topic, we interviewed Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed nutritionist and wellness expert with over a decade of experience in the field of natural health. \n\n### Understanding Fatigue\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Carter, thank you for joining us. To start, could you explain what fatigue is and why it occurs?\n\n**Dr. Carter:** Absolutely. Fatigue is a state of extreme tiredness, which can be physical, mental, or both. It is often caused by various factors, including lack of sleep, stress, poor nutrition, and underlying medical conditions. Chronic fatigue can significantly impact a person's quality of life, affecting their ability to concentrate, work, and enjoy daily activities.\n\n### Common Causes of Fatigue\n\n**Interviewer:** What are some common causes of fatigue that you see in your practice?\n\n**Dr. Carter:** There are numerous causes of fatigue.
