Foods such as fatty fish, berries, nuts, and green leafy vegetables are particularly beneficial.\n\n#### 2.

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each week.\n\n#### 3. Mental Stimulation\n\nEngaging in puzzles, reading, learning new skills, or playing musical instruments can help keep the brain active and agile.\n\n#### 4. Quality Sleep\n\nSleep is essential for memory consolidation and overall brain function. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night.\n\n#### 5. Stress Management\n\nChronic stress can have detrimental effects on brain health. Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, and deep-breathing exercises can help manage stress levels.\n\n#### 6. Social Connections\n\nMaintaining strong social ties can enhance emotional well-being and cognitive function. Engage regularly with friends and family, and participate in community activities.\n\n### What Role Do Supplements Play in Brain Health?\n\nSupplements can be a valuable addition to a brain health regimen, providing essential nutrients that support cognitive function.
