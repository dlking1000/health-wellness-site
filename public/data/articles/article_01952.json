In fact, according to the American Thyroid Association, up to 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease, and men are just as likely to be affected as women. Despite this, thyroid issues in men often go undiagnosed and untreated, leading to a range of debilitating symptoms that can impact daily life.\n\n### The Symptoms of Thyroid Issues in Men\n\nSo, what are the symptoms of thyroid issues in men? They can be subtle, but if you're experiencing any of the following, it's essential to speak with your healthcare provider:\n\n* Fatigue and lethargy\n* Weight gain or loss\n* Hair loss\n* Cold intolerance\n* Depression or anxiety\n* Memory problems\n* Muscle weakness\n* Changes in libido\n\nThese symptoms can be attributed to an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) or an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). Hypothyroidism is more common in men, and it occurs when the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones.\n\n### The Causes of Thyroid Issues in Men\n\nSo, what causes thyroid issues in men? The truth is that the exact causes are often complex and multifaceted. However, some common risk factors include:\n\n* Family history\n* Radiation exposure\n* Thyroid surgery\n* Autoimmune disorders\n* Certain medications\n* Iodine deficiency\n* Stress and anxiety\n\nStress and anxiety, in particular, can have a significant impact on thyroid function. When we're under chronic stress, our body produces cortisol, a hormone that can disrupt thyroid function. Many people find that brain health and tinnitus relief supplements can be helpful.

If you suspect you might have a thyroid problem, speak with your healthcare provider about getting tested. They may perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and order blood tests to determine your thyroid hormone levels.\n\nIf you're diagnosed with a thyroid issue, your healthcare provider may recommend medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of both. In some cases, medication may be necessary to regulate thyroid hormone levels. However, making healthy lifestyle changes can also help alleviate symptoms.\n\n### Lifestyle Changes to Support Thyroid Health\n\nSo, what lifestyle changes can you make to support thyroid health? Here are some tips:\n\n* Eat a balanced diet rich in iodine, selenium, and zinc\n* Exercise regularly to reduce stress and anxiety\n* Get enough sleep to support hormone regulation\n* Manage stress through relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga\n* Avoid exposure to environmental toxins\n\nIn addition to these lifestyle changes, some men find that metabolism boosters can help support weight management and overall health.
