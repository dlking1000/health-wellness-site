She was known for her vibrant spirit and dedication to her family. However, beneath her cheerful exterior lay a growing problem: inflammation. Clara had been dealing with persistent joint pain and swelling that made even the simplest tasks feel monumental.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, as Clara struggled to tie her shoelaces, her daughter Lily noticed her discomfort. \u201cMom, are you okay?\u201d Lily asked, concern etched on her youthful face. Clara sighed, \u201cI\u2019m fine, sweetheart. Just a bit of pain. I\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\nBut deep down, Clara knew this was more than just a passing ache.
