From her childhood days spent running in the sun to her teenage years filled with adventures, she seemed to embody the essence of health and vitality. However, beneath her cheerful exterior, Lila was grappling with a persistent enemy: eczema. This skin condition was not just a nuisance; it was a relentless battle that left her skin inflamed, itchy, and often covered in red patches.\n\nLila first noticed the symptoms when she was just a child. At first, her parents attributed it to allergies or dry skin, but as the years went by, it became clear that eczema was more than just a phase.
