Instead of reaching for a cup of coffee, she opts for an energy drink that contains a high caffeine content. This choice helps her feel alert and focused as she tackles her morning tasks.\n\nOne of Sarah\u2019s favorites is a well-known energy drink brand that boasts an impressive caffeine content.
