On the surface, Emma appeared to have it all\u2014supportive friends, a stable job at the local library, and a cozy apartment filled with the scent of fresh books. Yet, beneath her bright smile lay a darkness that weighed heavily on her heart.\n\nEmma had been grappling with an invisible foe known as depression. Many people do not understand that depression is more than just feeling sad; it is a complex mental health disorder affecting millions worldwide.
