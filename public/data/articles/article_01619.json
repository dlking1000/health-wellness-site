It's essential for immune function, skin health, and iron absorption. Increase your vitamin C intake by consuming foods rich in this vitamin, such as citrus fruits, berries, and leafy greens.\n\n### Day 4-6: Focus on Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is crucial for bone health, immune function, and mood regulation. Spend time outdoors, take vitamin D supplements, or consume vitamin D-rich foods like fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products.\n\n### Day 7: Review and Reflect\n\nTake a day to review your progress, reflect on how you're feeling, and make adjustments to your diet and supplementation routine as needed.\n\n## Week 2: Understanding Electrolytes\n\nElectrolytes are electrically charged minerals that regulate various bodily functions, including hydration, nerve function, and muscle contractions. The main electrolytes are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride.\n\n### Day 8-10: Focus on Sodium\n\nSodium is essential for fluid balance and nerve function. Consume sodium-rich foods like table salt, soy sauce, and processed meats in moderation.\n\n### Day 11-13: Focus on Potassium\n\nPotassium is crucial for heart health, muscle function, and hydration. Increase your potassium intake by consuming foods rich in this electrolyte, such as bananas, avocados, and sweet potatoes.\n\n### Day 14: Review and Reflect\n\nTake a day to review your progress, reflect on how you're feeling, and make adjustments to your diet and supplementation routine as needed.\n\n## Week 3: Balancing Vitamins and Electrolytes\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of vitamins and electrolytes, it's time to focus on balancing them in your diet and supplementation routine.\n\n### Day 15-17: Focus on Vitamin B Complex\n\nVitamin B complex is essential for energy production, nerve function, and heart health. Consume foods rich in vitamin B complex, such as whole grains, lean meats, and fish.\n\n### Day 18-20: Focus on Magnesium\n\nMagnesium is crucial for muscle function, nerve function, and bone health. Increase your magnesium intake by consuming foods rich in this electrolyte, such as dark leafy greens, nuts, and seeds.\n\n### Day 21: Review and Reflect\n\nTake a day to review your progress, reflect on how you're feeling, and make adjustments to your diet and supplementation routine as needed.\n\n## Week 4: Putting it all Together\n\nIn the final week of our challenge, we'll focus on putting everything we've learned into practice.\n\n### Day 22-24: Focus on Hydration\n\nHydration is essential for maintaining optimal health.
