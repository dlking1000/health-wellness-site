It can lead to severe complications such as heart disease and stroke if left untreated. In this interview, we'll discuss the upper number in blood pressure readings, its significance, and how to maintain healthy blood pressure levels with the help of Dr. Rachel Thompson, a cardiologist.\n\n**Interviewer:** Hi, Dr. Thompson! Thanks for joining us today. To start, could you explain what the upper number in a blood pressure reading represents?\n\n**Dr. Rachel Thompson:** Absolutely! The upper number in a blood pressure reading, also known as the systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure inside your blood vessels when your heart beats. It indicates the force your heart uses to pump blood throughout your body.\n\n**Interviewer:** At what level should people become concerned about their upper blood pressure number?\n\n**Dr. Rachel Thompson:** A normal blood pressure reading is typically around 120/80 mmHg. If the systolic blood pressure consistently reads 130 mmHg or higher, it's considered stage 1 hypertension. When it reaches 140 mmHg or higher, it's stage 2 hypertension, which requires medical attention and treatment.\n\n**Interviewer:** What factors contribute to a higher-than-normal upper blood pressure number?\n\n**Dr. Rachel Thompson:** Several factors can contribute to an elevated upper blood pressure number. These include:\n\n1. Age\n2. Family history\n3. Obesity or being overweight\n4. Lack of physical activity\n5. Poor diet, especially one high in sodium and low in potassium\n6. Excessive alcohol consumption\n7. Smoking\n8. Stress\n\n**Interviewer:** How can people maintain a healthy upper blood pressure number?\n\n**Dr. Rachel Thompson:** Making lifestyle changes is crucial for maintaining a healthy upper blood pressure number. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy weight.\n2. Engage in regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise per week.\n3. Follow a balanced, heart-healthy diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) or Mediterranean diet.\n4. Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day.\n5. Avoid or limit alcohol consumption to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.\n6. Quit smoking.\n7. Manage stress through relaxation techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.\n\n**Interviewer:** Are there any natural supplements that can support healthy blood pressure levels?\n\n**Dr. Rachel Thompson:** Some natural supplements, such as coenzyme Q10, magnesium, and fish oil, may help support healthy blood pressure levels. However, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n\n**Interviewer:** How often should people check their blood pressure levels?\n\n**Dr. Rachel Thompson:** If you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure or are at risk, it's essential to monitor your blood pressure levels regularly. At minimum, check your blood pressure at least once a month. However, your healthcare provider may recommend more frequent monitoring.\n\n**Interviewer:** In conclusion, what advice would you give to those concerned about their upper blood pressure number?\n\n**Dr. Rachel Thompson:** My advice is to take an active role in managing your blood pressure levels through lifestyle changes and regular monitoring.
