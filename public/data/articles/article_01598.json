However, over the past year, she noticed a significant decline in her overall health. She was constantly fatigued, her skin was breaking out, and she experienced frequent digestive issues. Despite her best efforts to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly, Emma couldn't shake off the feeling of being unwell.\n\n\"I feel like I'm stuck in a rut,\" Emma confided in her best friend, Rachel. \"I'm tired all the time, and my skin is a mess.
