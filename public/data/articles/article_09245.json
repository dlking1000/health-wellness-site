Sarah was like many others\u2014busy and often overwhelmed. Between her job, family commitments, and social obligations, she hardly had a moment to think about her health. Yet, deep down, she felt a yearning for something more. She wanted to feel vibrant, energized, and healthy.\n\nOne day, as Sarah scrolled through social media during her lunch break, she stumbled upon a post about the importance of vitamins.
