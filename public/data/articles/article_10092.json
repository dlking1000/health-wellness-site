Medical Dermatology and Skin Disease Management\n\nSkin health centers provide expert evaluation and treatment for a wide range of dermatological conditions:\n\n- **Acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea**: Chronic inflammatory conditions requiring personalized management plans.\n- **Skin cancer detection:** Through **total body skin exams**, dermatologists perform thorough visual inspections, including dermoscopy, to identify suspicious lesions early, improving treatment outcomes and survival rates. Areas such as scalp, nails, mucous membranes, and sun-exposed sites receive special attention during exams[3][6].\n- **Biopsies and referrals:** For suspicious or unusual lesions, dermatologists conduct biopsies or refer to specialists for further care.\n\nPrimary care physicians are encouraged to collaborate, but dermatology centers remain the definitive resource for specialized diagnosis and treatment[3].\n\n#### 2. Cosmetic and Rejuvenation Treatments\n\nSkin health centers offer innovative procedures aimed at enhancing skin texture, tone, and appearance:\n\n- **Laser Skin Resurfacing:** Uses focused light energy to remove damaged skin layers and stimulate new collagen, reducing wrinkles, scars, and pigmentation.
