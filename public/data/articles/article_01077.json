I lie in bed, heart racing, my mind already consumed by the endless list of tasks and worries that will define my day. This is the familiar yet unwelcome start to my morning as an individual living with anxiety.\n\n## Morning Routines and Challenges\n\n6:00 AM - I force myself out of bed, already feeling the weight of the day ahead.

The thought of small talk and maintaining a cheerful demeanor fills me with dread.\n\n5:00 PM - I manage to get through the obligatory after-work drinks, but I find myself constantly scanning the room, looking for an opportunity to make a graceful exit. The noise and crowds are overwhelming, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n6:30 PM - Finally, I can retreat to the solace of my home. I take off my shoes and collapse on the couch, letting out a long sigh of relief. The safe, familiar environment provides a sense of comfort, but the anxiety lingers, preventing me from truly relaxing.\n\n## Evening Routines and Nighttime Struggles\n\n7:00 PM - Dinner preparation is a challenge, as I struggle to focus on the task at hand.

These methods sometimes provide temporary respite, but the anxiety always finds its way back, disrupting my sleep.\n\n12:00 AM - Frustrated and exhausted, I finally give in to the reality of my situation. I get up and make a warm cup of herbal tea, hoping the soothing ritual will help calm my nerves. As I sip the tea, I try to practice self-compassion, reminding myself that this is a common struggle for many individuals living with anxiety.\n\n2:00 AM - After several more hours of restless tossing and turning, I eventually drift off to sleep, only to repeat the cycle again in the morning.
