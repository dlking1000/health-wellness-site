Yawning is often associated with sleepiness or boredom, but it can also be a response to stress. When we encounter stress, our body reacts in various ways, and yawning can be a way for the body to regulate brain temperature and increase alertness.\n\nThe physiological response behind yawning involves the stretching of the jaw and facial muscles, which can help increase oxygen intake. However, when stress yawning becomes frequent, it may indicate underlying issues that need addressing. This challenge will help you identify triggers and develop strategies to minimize stress yawning.\n\n### Week 1: Awareness and Identification\n\n**Day 1: Keep a Yawning Journal**  \nBegin by tracking your yawning episodes. Note the time, situation, and emotional state when you yawn. This will help you identify patterns.\n\n**Day 2: Recognize Triggers**  \nReview your yawning journal and highlight any common triggers. Are you more likely to yawn during stressful situations or when you are bored? \n\n**Day 3: Mindfulness Meditation**  \nSpend 10 minutes practicing mindfulness meditation. Focus on your breath and observe your thoughts without judgment. This can help reduce stress levels.\n\n**Day 4: Deep Breathing Exercises**  \nPractice deep breathing for five minutes. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly.
