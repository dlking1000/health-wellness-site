In this article, we aim to clarify these terms, explore their differences, and delve into how Arthritis and Rheumatism Associates in Chevy Chase can help manage these conditions effectively. \n\n### What is Arthritis?\n\nArthritis is an umbrella term that describes over 100 different conditions affecting the joints. It leads to pain, swelling, and stiffness, primarily characterized by inflammation.
