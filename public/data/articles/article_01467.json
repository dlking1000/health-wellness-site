Incorporate plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish like salmon and mackerel, as well as antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables. Limit processed foods, added sugars, and unhealthy fats, which can have a detrimental impact on brain health.\n\n#### Step 2: Engage in Regular Physical Activity\nRegular exercise not only keeps your body fit but also benefits your brain. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, most days of the week.

Regular stress-relieving activities can improve focus, memory, and overall cognitive performance.\n\n#### Step 4: Prioritize Quality Sleep\nAdequate, high-quality sleep is essential for brain health. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and establish a consistent sleep routine. Avoid screen time and stimulating activities close to bedtime, and create a calming sleep environment to ensure your brain can fully rest and rejuvenate.\n\n#### Step 5: Engage in Brain-Stimulating Activities\nChallenge your mind and keep it active by engaging in mentally stimulating activities. This could include learning a new skill, such as playing a musical instrument or a new language, solving puzzles, or participating in brain games and cognitive exercises. Continuously challenging your brain helps to maintain and even enhance cognitive abilities.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\nWhile implementing these steps, be mindful of the following common mistakes that can hinder your brain health efforts:\n\n1. Neglecting a balanced, nutrient-rich diet\n2. Failing to incorporate regular physical activity\n3. Allowing chronic stress to go unmanaged\n4.
