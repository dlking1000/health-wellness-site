This can include walking, jogging, cycling, or any activity that gets your heart rate up.\n\n2. **Eat a Balanced Diet**\n   Focus on incorporating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your diet. Reducing processed foods and added sugars can significantly benefit heart health.\n\n3. **Manage Stress**\n   Stress management techniques such as yoga, meditation, or mindfulness can help reduce stress-related heart risks.
