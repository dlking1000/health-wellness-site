She was an avid gardener and spent most of her days tending to her blooming flowers and vegetables. Yet, over time, she began to notice an unsettling change in her body. The vibrant colors of her garden were overshadowed by a dull ache in her joints and a persistent fatigue that seemed to sap her energy.\n\nLily's days became less joyous as she struggled with inflammation.
