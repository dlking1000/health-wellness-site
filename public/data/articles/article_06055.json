Look for medium-sized zucchinis, as they are typically more flavorful and easier to work with. \n\n#### Filling Options\n\nThe filling is where you can get creative! Here are some heart healthy choices to consider:\n\n- **Lean Proteins**: Ground turkey, chicken, or plant-based proteins like lentils and black beans work well.\n- **Vegetables**: Bell peppers, onions, spinach, and mushrooms can add flavor and nutrition.\n- **Whole Grains**: Quinoa, brown rice, or farro can add texture and bulk.\n- **Herbs and Spices**: Fresh herbs like basil, parsley, or thyme can enhance flavor without adding salt.\n\n#### Cheese (Optional)\n\nUsing low-fat cheese or nutritional yeast can add a savory flavor while keeping the dish heart healthy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Making Heart Healthy Zucchini Boats\n\nNow that you have your ingredients ready, let’s get started on making these delicious heart healthy zucchini boats.\n\n#### Step 1: Prepare the Zucchini\n\n1. **Wash the Zucchini**: Rinse the zucchini under cold water to remove any dirt.\n2. **Slice in Half**: Cut each zucchini in half lengthwise.\n3. **Scoop Out the Center**: Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and some of the flesh, creating a boat shape. Be careful not to scoop too deep; leave enough flesh for structure.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Filling\n\n1. **Cook the Protein**: If you are using meat, cook it in a skillet over medium heat until fully cooked. Drain any excess fat.\n2. **Add Vegetables**: Add chopped vegetables to the skillet with the protein and sauté until softened.\n3. **Mix in Grains**: Stir in any cooked grains you are using, along with herbs and spices. Mix well and season with black pepper, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt if desired.\n\n#### Step 3: Stuff the Zucchini\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.\n2. **Fill the Zucchini Boats**: Spoon the filling into each zucchini half, packing it in gently. If you are using cheese, sprinkle it on top of the filling.\n\n#### Step 4: Bake the Zucchini Boats\n\n1. **Arrange on a Baking Sheet**: Place the filled zucchini boats on a baking sheet, cut side up.\n2. **Cover with Foil**: Cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil to keep moisture in.\n3. **Bake**: Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes if you want a slightly crispy top.\n\n#### Step 5: Serve and Enjoy\n\n1. **Cool Slightly**: Let the zucchini boats cool for a few minutes before serving.\n2. **Garnish**: Top with fresh herbs or a squeeze of lemon juice for added flavor.\n3. **Plate**: Serve warm, either as a main dish or a side.\n\n### Tips for Perfect Zucchini Boats\n\n- **Experiment with Flavors**: Don’t hesitate to try different combinations of fillings. The versatility of zucchini allows you to adapt the recipe to your taste.\n- **Make It Ahead of Time**: You can prepare the filling in advance and assemble the boats before baking.
