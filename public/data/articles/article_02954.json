It is typically caused by a buildup of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that forms on the teeth.\n\n### What are the symptoms of gum inflammation?\n\nThe most common symptoms of gum inflammation include:\n- Red, swollen, or tender gums\n- Bleeding gums, especially when brushing or flossing\n- Bad breath or a persistent unpleasant taste in the mouth\n- Receding gums\n- Increased sensitivity in the teeth\n\n### What causes gum inflammation?\n\nThe primary cause of gum inflammation is poor oral hygiene, which allows plaque to accumulate on the teeth and irritate the gum tissues. Other contributing factors can include:\n- Hormonal changes (e.g., during pregnancy or menopause)\n- Certain medications (e.g., some blood pressure or antidepressant drugs)\n- Underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes, HIV/AIDS)\n- Tobacco use\n- Genetics\n\n### How can gum inflammation be treated?\n\nEffective treatment for gum inflammation typically involves a combination of the following approaches:\n\n#### 1. Improved oral hygiene\n- Brushing teeth twice daily with a soft-bristled toothbrush\n- Flossing daily to remove plaque from between teeth\n- Using an antimicrobial mouthwash to reduce bacterial growth\n\n#### 2. Professional dental cleaning\n- Regular professional cleanings by a dentist or dental hygienist to remove hardened plaque and tartar\n- Scaling and root planing to smooth the tooth roots and help the gums reattach to the teeth\n\n#### 3. Topical treatments\n- Over-the-counter gum-soothing gels or ointments containing ingredients like aloe vera or hydrogen peroxide\n- Prescription-strength medicated mouthwashes or gels containing antibacterial agents\n\n#### 4.
