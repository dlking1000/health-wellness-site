That's why we sat down with Samantha Johnson, a registered dietitian and nutrition expert, to discuss how to navigate the menu at Jimmy John's and make the healthiest decisions for your body.\n\n### Welcome, Samantha! Can you start by telling us a bit about your background and expertise in nutrition?\n\nAbsolutely! I'm a registered dietitian with over 10 years of experience helping clients achieve their health and wellness goals. My passion is empowering people to make informed choices about the foods they eat, especially when it comes to eating out. I believe that with the right knowledge and strategies, you can enjoy your favorite fast-food spots while still nourishing your body.\n\n### What are some of the key nutritional considerations when dining at Jimmy John's?\n\nJimmy John's is known for its wide variety of sandwiches, which can present both opportunities and challenges when it comes to nutrition. On the positive side, their menu features many options that are high in protein, thanks to the deli meats and cheeses. Protein is an essential macronutrient that helps keep you feeling full and satisfied.\n\nHowever, many of the sandwiches are also high in sodium and calories, especially when you start adding condiments and extras. The bread itself can be a source of refined carbs, which can spike your blood sugar levels and lead to energy crashes.\n\n### Can you provide some tips for making healthier choices at Jimmy John's?\n\nAbsolutely! Here are some of my top recommendations:\n\n#### Focus on Lean Protein\nWhen building your sandwich, opt for leaner protein sources like turkey, roast beef, or tuna salad. These provide a boost of protein without excessive fat or calories.\n\n#### Choose Whole Grain Bread\nInstead of the traditional white bread, go for the whole wheat or multigrain options. Whole grains are more nutrient-dense and can help you feel fuller for longer.\n\n#### Load Up on Veggies\nAsk for extra lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and other fresh veggies on your sandwich. These add valuable vitamins, minerals, and fiber without a lot of extra calories.\n\n#### Watch the Sauces and Condiments\nThings like mayo, oil-based dressings, and specialty sauces can quickly turn a relatively healthy sandwich into a calorie bomb. Opt for mustard, vinegar, or a small amount of these toppings instead.\n\n#### Pair with a Salad\nIf you're looking for a more well-rounded meal, consider pairing your sandwich with a fresh side salad. This can help boost your vegetable intake and provide additional nutrients.\n\n### How can people make the most of the \"Unwich\" option at Jimmy John's?\n\nThe Unwich is a fantastic choice for those looking to cut down on carbs and calories. It involves swapping the traditional bread for a lettuce wrap, which is a great way to reduce your intake of refined carbs. Plus, the extra veggies in the lettuce wrap can add some extra fiber and nutrients.\n\nWhen ordering an Unwich, I'd recommend sticking to the leaner protein options and being mindful of any high-calorie toppings or condiments. You can also ask for extra veggies to be added to really make it a nutrient-dense meal.\n\n### What about side options - any recommendations there?\n\nThe side options at Jimmy John's can be a bit tricky. Many of the chips and cookies are quite high in calories, fat, and refined carbs. However, they do offer a few healthier choices:\n\n- Pickle spears: A low-calorie, crunchy option that can add some flavor to your meal.\n- Whole fruit: If available, fresh fruit like apples or bananas can be a nutritious side.\n- Unwich lettuce wrap: You can order an extra lettuce wrap as a side to complement your main sandwich.\n\nThe key is to be mindful of portion sizes, even with the healthier sides. It's easy to overdo it, so try to stick to one serving.\n\n### What about drinks - any tips there?\n\nWhen it comes to beverages, I always recommend sticking to water or unsweetened options. The flavored or sweetened drinks at Jimmy John's can be loaded with added sugars, which can contribute to weight gain and other health issues.\n\nIf you're craving something other than water, go for an unsweet iced tea or a diet soda. Avoid the regular sodas, which are essentially just empty calories.\n\n### In your opinion, what are some of the healthiest sandwich options at Jimmy John's?\n\nSome of my top picks for the healthiest sandwiches at Jimmy John's include:\n\n- The Veggie Unwich: This lettuce-wrapped sandwich is loaded with fresh veggies and has no meat, making it a great option for vegetarians or those looking to reduce their meat intake.\n- The Turkey Tom: The turkey is a lean protein source, and you can load it up with veggies for a nutrient-dense meal.\n- The Tuna Salad: Tuna is an excellent source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Just be mindful of any high-calorie toppings.\n- The Beach Club Unwich: This lettuce-wrapped sandwich features turkey, bacon, and avocado, providing a balance of protein, healthy fats, and vegetables.\n\nThe key is to focus on lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of veggies when building your sandwich. And don't forget to watch out for those high-calorie extras!\n\n### What advice would you give to someone who wants to make healthier choices at Jimmy John's but is worried about feeling deprived?\n\nI completely understand the concern about feeling deprived.
