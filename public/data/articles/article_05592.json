Distinguishing between occasional tiredness and chronic fatigue is essential, as the latter can indicate underlying health issues that require medical attention.\n\n### Types of Fatigue\n\nFatigue can be classified into several types, including:\n\n- **Physical Fatigue**: A decrease in physical stamina that can arise from excessive exercise, lack of sleep, or medical conditions.\n- **Mental Fatigue**: A decline in cognitive function, often associated with prolonged periods of mental work or stress.\n- **Emotional Fatigue**: A state of emotional exhaustion that may occur due to stress, anxiety, or significant life changes.\n\n### Common Causes of Fatigue\n\nUnderstanding the root causes of fatigue is crucial for effectively addressing it. Some common causes include:\n\n#### 1.
