However, many individuals are unaware of how to assess their liver health or the significance of regular liver health tests. This 30-day challenge aims to educate you about liver health tests and provide actionable steps to enhance your liver function.\n\n### What is a Liver Health Test?\n\nA liver health test, often referred to as liver function tests, is a series of blood tests that measure the levels of various enzymes, proteins, and substances produced by the liver. These tests help assess the liver's ability to perform its functions effectively and can detect liver diseases or conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and cirrhosis.\n\n### Why is Liver Health Important?\n\nYour liver is responsible for filtering toxins from your blood, producing essential proteins, and aiding in digestion by producing bile. Maintaining optimal liver health is crucial for overall well-being. Poor liver health can lead to serious health issues, including liver failure, which can be life-threatening.\n\n### Week 1: Understanding Your Liver Health\n\n#### Day 1: Learn About Liver Functions\n\nStart your challenge by researching the various functions of the liver.
