The thyroid gland produces two primary hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, energy, and growth. When thyroid hormone levels are imbalanced, it can lead to a range of symptoms, from fatigue and weight gain to anxiety and depression.\n\nMany people find additional support helpful.
