Understanding what constitutes healthy blood pressure for your age and gender is crucial for maintaining long-term wellness.\n\nThis comprehensive guide explains blood pressure basics, provides detailed blood pressure charts by age and gender, explores factors that influence readings, and offers practical tips for maintaining healthy levels. Whether you're monitoring your own health or supporting a loved one, this information empowers you to make informed decisions.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Blood Pressure and Why Does It Matter?\n\nBlood pressure measures the force of blood pushing against artery walls as the heart pumps blood through the body. It's recorded as two numbers:\n\n- **Systolic pressure**: The top number, representing pressure when the heart beats\n- **Diastolic pressure**: The bottom number, representing pressure when the heart rests between beats\n\nHealthy blood pressure is essential because:\n- It ensures proper blood flow to organs and tissues\n- It reduces strain on the heart and blood vessels\n- It lowers risks of cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems, and stroke\n\n### How Blood Pressure Changes With Age\n\nBlood pressure naturally tends to increase with age due to:\n- **Arterial stiffening**: Blood vessels lose elasticity over time\n- **Hormonal changes**: Particularly during menopause in women\n- **Lifestyle factors**: Accumulated effects of diet, exercise, and stress\n- **Metabolic changes**: Shifts in how the body processes nutrients and maintains weight\n\nUnderstanding these age-related patterns helps in interpreting blood pressure readings appropriately for different life stages.\n\n---\n\n## Blood Pressure Chart by Age and Gender\n\nHealthy blood pressure ranges vary somewhat by age and gender due to physiological differences. The following charts provide general guidelines, but individual variations may occur.\n\n### Blood Pressure Categories (All Adults)\n\n| Category          | Systolic (mmHg) | Diastolic (mmHg) |\n|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Normal            | Less than 120   | Less than 80     |\n| Elevated          | 120-129         | Less than 80     |\n| Stage 1 Hypertension | 130-139     | 80-89            |\n| Stage 2 Hypertension | 140+        | 90+              |\n| Hypertensive Crisis | 180+        | 120+             |\n\n*Note: These are general guidelines.
