I began to research and educate myself on nail fungus, its causes, and its treatment options. I learned about the importance of maintaining good nail hygiene, keeping my feet dry, and wearing breathable shoes. I also discovered the role of nutrition in promoting healthy nail growth.\n\n### The Journey: Combating Nail Fungus with Light Therapy and Nutrition\n\nI started by making lifestyle changes. I began to wear socks made of natural fibers, changed my shoes frequently, and kept my feet dry. I also incorporated light therapy into my daily routine, using a specialized device that emitted specific wavelengths of light to target the fungus. Additionally, I focused on nourishing my body with a balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\n\nMany people find that nail health supplements can be helpful.
