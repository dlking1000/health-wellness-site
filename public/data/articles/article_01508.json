Nail health refers to the overall well-being of the nails, including their appearance, strength, and functionality. It's important because healthy nails are a sign of overall health and wellness.

Neglecting nail health can lead to physical discomfort, such as hangnails or ingrown nails, which can affect one's overall quality of life.\n\n### Factors that Affect Nail Health\n\n**Interviewer:** What are some factors that can affect nail health?\n\n**Dr. Graham:** There are several factors that can affect nail health, including:\n\n* Nutrient deficiencies, such as a lack of biotin, iron, or vitamin D\n* Frequent exposure to water or chemicals, such as cleaning products or nail polish remover\n* Poor circulation, which can be caused by conditions like diabetes or Raynaud's disease\n* Age-related changes, such as thinning nails or slower nail growth\n* Trauma or injury to the nails, such as biting or picking at them\n\n### Signs of Unhealthy Nails\n\n**Interviewer:** What are some signs of unhealthy nails?\n\n**Dr. Graham:** Some signs of unhealthy nails include:\n\n* Brittle, weak, or peeling nails\n* Discoloration or changes in nail texture\n* Slow nail growth\n* Pain or discomfort in the nails or cuticles\n* Nail separation from the nail bed\n\n### Tips for Maintaining Healthy Nails\n\n**Interviewer:** Can you provide some tips for maintaining healthy nails?\n\n**Dr. Graham:** Absolutely!
