This article presents a comprehensive 30-day challenge designed to boost your brain health, with a special focus on activities and resources available in Scotland.

Foods rich in omega-three fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins are essential. Incorporate fish, nuts, berries, and leafy greens into your meals. Consider meal prepping to ensure you have brain-healthy options ready.\n\n#### Day 3: Hydration Matters\n\nHydration is key to cognitive function. Aim for at least eight glasses of water daily. Add herbal teas or infused water for variety.
