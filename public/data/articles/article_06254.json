It reflects how hard your heart is working to pump blood throughout your body. While many individuals worry about high blood pressure, a significant number experience the opposite issue: consistently low blood pressure. If you find yourself asking why your blood pressure keeps dropping, this guide is designed to provide clarity and actionable insights.\n\n### What is Blood Pressure?\n\nBlood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is recorded with two numbers:\n- **Systolic pressure**: The top number, indicating the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats.\n- **Diastolic pressure**: The bottom number, indicating the pressure in your arteries when your heart is resting between beats.\n\nNormal blood pressure is typically around 120/80 mmHg. Anything below 90/60 mmHg is considered low blood pressure, or hypotension.\n\n### Types of Low Blood Pressure\n\nThere are several types of low blood pressure:\n- **Orthostatic hypotension**: A sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up from a sitting or lying position.\n- **Postprandial hypotension**: A drop in blood pressure after eating.\n- **Neurally mediated hypotension**: A drop in blood pressure that occurs after standing for long periods due to miscommunication between the heart and the brain.\n- **Severe hypotension**: This can occur in life-threatening situations, such as severe blood loss or an infection (septic shock).\n\n### Common Causes of Low Blood Pressure\n\nUnderstanding the underlying causes of low blood pressure can help you manage or prevent it. Here are some common factors:\n\n#### 1. Dehydration\n\nWhen your body loses more water than it takes in, it can lead to dehydration, which reduces blood volume and causes blood pressure to drop. This can happen due to excessive sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\n#### 2. Heart Problems\n\nCertain heart conditions can lead to low blood pressure by affecting your heart's ability to pump blood effectively. This includes issues like bradycardia (slow heart rate) or heart valve problems.\n\n#### 3. Endocrine Disorders\n\nHormonal imbalances can affect blood pressure. Conditions like Addison's disease, underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), or diabetes can lead to low blood pressure.\n\n#### 4. Nutritional Deficiencies\n\nA lack of essential nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and folate, can prevent your body from producing enough red blood cells, leading to low blood pressure.\n\n#### 5. Medications\n\nCertain medications can cause low blood pressure as a side effect. This includes diuretics, beta-blockers, and some antidepressants. If you suspect your medication is affecting your blood pressure, consult your healthcare provider.\n\n#### 6. Severe Infection\n\nSepticemia, a severe infection that spreads throughout the body, can lead to a dramatic drop in blood pressure, known as septic shock.\n\n### Symptoms of Low Blood Pressure\n\nNot everyone with low blood pressure will experience symptoms. However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:\n- Dizziness or lightheadedness\n- Fainting\n- Fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Nausea\n\n### When to See a Doctor\n\nIf you experience persistent symptoms of low blood pressure or sudden changes in your blood pressure readings, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider. They can help determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\n### How to Manage Low Blood Pressure\n\nHere are some effective strategies to manage low blood pressure:\n\n#### 1. Stay Hydrated\n\nDrinking plenty of fluids can help maintain blood volume and prevent dehydration. Consider electrolyte-rich drinks, especially during hot weather or after physical activity.\n\n#### 2. Eat Small, Frequent Meals\n\nLarge meals can cause postprandial hypotension. Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help prevent blood pressure from dropping after eating.\n\n#### 3. Increase Salt Intake\n\nSodium can help raise blood pressure, but it is essential to consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes to your salt consumption, especially if you have other health conditions.\n\n#### 4. Monitor Your Medications\n\nIf you suspect your medications are causing low blood pressure, discuss this with your healthcare provider. They may adjust your dosage or suggest alternative treatments.\n\n#### 5. Wear Compression Stockings\n\nCompression stockings can help improve circulation and prevent blood from pooling in your legs, which can help maintain blood pressure.\n\n#### 6. Lifestyle Changes\n\nIncorporating regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing stress can significantly improve your overall cardiovascular health and help regulate blood pressure levels.\n\n### Natural Supplements for Blood Pressure Support\n\nMany people find that a nail health supplement can be helpful for overall health and well-being.
