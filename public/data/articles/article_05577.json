Common options include:\n\n- **Medications**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, corticosteroids may be prescribed.\n- **Physical Therapy**: A physical therapist can develop a personalized exercise program to strengthen the foot and improve flexibility.\n- **Orthotic Devices**: Custom shoe inserts or braces can provide support and alleviate pressure on affected joints.\n- **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce stress on the feet, and incorporating low-impact exercises can be beneficial.\n- **Surgery**: In severe cases where conservative treatments are ineffective, surgical options such as joint fusion or replacement may be considered.\n\n### Can Diet Play a Role in Managing Arthritis?\n\nYes, diet can significantly impact arthritis management. Certain foods may help reduce inflammation, while others may exacerbate symptoms.
