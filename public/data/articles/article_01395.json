With the right strategies, you can enjoy a delicious meal while keeping calories, sodium, and unhealthy fats in check.\n\nThis step-by-step guide will show you how to navigate the menu, customize your order, and balance indulgence with smart nutrition. Whether you\u2019re watching your weight, managing blood pressure, or simply aiming for a healthier diet, these tips will help you make better choices without sacrificing flavor.\n\n---\n\n## Why Nutrition at Jersey Mike\u2019s Matters\n\nFast-casual restaurants like Jersey Mike\u2019s offer convenience and taste, but many menu items are packed with refined carbs, processed meats, and excess sodium. A single sub can contain a full day\u2019s worth of sodium, while loaded sandwiches may deliver over 1,000 calories in one sitting.\n\nMaking mindful choices helps you:\n- **Control calorie intake** to support weight management\n- **Reduce sodium** for better heart health and blood pressure\n- **Boost protein and fiber** to stay full and energized\n- **Minimize processed ingredients** for long-term wellness\n\nThe good news? Jersey Mike\u2019s offers plenty of ways to customize your meal for better nutrition\u2014if you know what to ask for.\n\n---\n\n## What You Need Before You Order\n\nTo make the healthiest choices at Jersey Mike\u2019s, gather these tools:\n\n1. **Nutrition Information** \u2013 Check Jersey Mike\u2019s [official nutrition guide](https://www.jerseymikes.com/nutrition) (available online) to compare options before you arrive.\n2. **A Plan** \u2013 Decide whether you\u2019re prioritizing lower calories, less sodium, or higher protein.\n3. **Customization Mindset** \u2013 Be ready to modify your order (e.g., swapping bread, skipping cheese, or loading up on veggies).\n4. **Portion Awareness** \u2013 Consider splitting a large sub or opting for a mini if available.\n5. **Hydration** \u2013 Bring water or unsweetened tea to avoid sugary drinks.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Ordering a Healthier Jersey Mike\u2019s Sub\n\nFollow these steps to build a balanced, nutritious meal:\n\n### **Step 1: Choose the Right Bread**\nThe foundation of your sub sets the tone for nutrition. Skip the white bread and opt for:\n\n\u2705 **Whole Wheat or Multigrain** \u2013 Higher in fiber (3\u20134g per serving) and nutrients than white.\n\u2705 **Wrap or Lettuce Wrap** \u2013 Cuts carbs and calories (some locations offer these).\n\u274c **White Italian or Sesame Bread** \u2013 Low in fiber and nutrients, higher glycemic impact.\n\n*Pro Tip:* If you\u2019re watching carbs, ask for a **\"sub in a tub\"**\u2014your sandwich ingredients served in a bowl without bread.\n\n### **Step 2: Pick a Lean Protein**\nProtein keeps you full and supports muscle health, but some meats are loaded with sodium and saturated fat. Best choices:\n\n\u2705 **Turkey Breast** \u2013 Lean, high-protein (around 20g per serving), and lower in fat.\n\u2705 **Roast Beef (Lean Cut)** \u2013 A good iron source with moderate fat.\n\u2705 **Grilled Chicken** \u2013 One of the healthiest options if available (not all locations offer it).\n\u2705 **Ham (Low-Sodium if Possible)** \u2013 Opt for natural or lower-sodium versions.\n\u274c **Salami, Pepperoni, or Capicola** \u2013 High in sodium and saturated fat.\n\n*Avoid processed meats* if you\u2019re watching sodium or heart health. Instead, **double up on turkey or chicken** for extra protein.\n\n### **Step 3: Load Up on Veggies**\nVeggies add fiber, vitamins, and crunch without many calories. Always say **\"extra veggies\"** and include:\n\n- Lettuce\n- Tomatoes\n- Onions\n- Green Peppers\n- Jalape\u00f1os (if you like spice)\n- Cucumbers\n- Spinach (if available)\n\n*Ask for*\"**the works\"** but specify **no pickles or olives** if you\u2019re limiting sodium.\n\n### **Step 4: Skip or Modify the Cheese**\nCheese adds flavor but also saturated fat and sodium. Options:\n\n\u2705 **Skip Cheese** \u2013 Saves 50\u2013100 calories and 3\u20135g of saturated fat.\n\u2705 **Swiss or Provolone (1 Slice)** \u2013 Lower in fat than American or cheddar.\n\u274c **American or Cheddar Cheese** \u2013 Higher in sodium and saturated fat.\n\n*If you love cheese*, ask for **half the usual amount** to cut back without feeling deprived.\n\n### **Step 5: Choose Condiments Wisely**\nSauces and spreads can turn a healthy sub into a calorie bomb. Best picks:\n\n\u2705 **Mustard (Yellow or Dijon)** \u2013 Zero calories, adds flavor.\n\u2705 **Vinegar & Oil (Light on Oil)** \u2013 Ask for **\"half the oil\"** to reduce calories.\n\u2705 **Hot Peppers or Spices** \u2013 Boosts metabolism without calories.\n\u274c **Mayo, Chipotle Sauce, or Ranch** \u2013 High in calories and unhealthy fats (1 tbsp mayo = ~90 cal).\n\n*Request sauces on the side* so you control the portion.\n\n### **Step 6: Watch the Extras**\nSmall add-ons can sabotage your meal. Avoid or limit:\n\n\u274c **Chips** \u2013 Opt for a side salad or fruit cup instead.\n\u274c **Soda or Sweet Tea** \u2013 Stick to water, unsweetened iced tea, or black coffee.\n\u274c **Bacon or Extra Meat** \u2013 Adds unnecessary sodium and fat.\n\u274c **Cooking the Sub \"Mike\u2019s Way\"** \u2013 This means extra oil, salt, and spices (ask for **\"no Mike\u2019s Way\"**).\n\n### **Step 7: Consider a Salad (With Smart Toppings)**\nIf you\u2019re cutting carbs, Jersey Mike\u2019s salads can be a great option\u2014**if** you build them right:\n\n\u2705 **Base:** Mixed greens or spinach\n\u2705 **Protein:** Grilled chicken or turkey\n\u2705 **Veggies:** All available (skip pickles/olives if watching sodium)\n\u2705 **Dressing:** Oil & vinegar (light on oil) or mustard\n\u274c **Avoid:** Croutons, creamy dressings, and excessive cheese\n\n*Pro Tip:* Ask for **double protein** and **light dressing** to make it a filling meal.\n\n### **Step 8: Balance Your Meal**\nIf you\u2019re indulging in a higher-calorie sub, balance it with:\n\n- A **side of fresh fruit** instead of chips\n- **Water or sparkling water** instead of soda\n- A **small sub (7-inch)** instead of a giant (15-inch)\n\n*Example of a Balanced Order:*\n- **7-inch Turkey & Provolone on Whole Wheat**\n- **Extra Veggies, Mustard, Light Oil**\n- **Side Salad with Vinegar**\n- **Water or Unsweetened Tea**\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\nEven with good intentions, it\u2019s easy to slip up. Watch out for:\n\n1. **Assuming \"Light\" Means Healthy** \u2013 Some \"light\" subs still have high sodium or processed meats.\n2. **Overdoing the Portion** \u2013 A 15-inch sub can feed two; opt for a 7-inch or mini.\n3. **Forgetting About Drinks** \u2013 A 20 oz soda adds ~250 empty calories.\n4. **Skipping Veggies** \u2013 They add volume and nutrients for minimal calories.\n5. **Not Checking Nutrition Info** \u2013 Some \"healthy-sounding\" subs (like the #13 Original Italian) have over 1,000mg of sodium.\n6. **Ordering \"Mike\u2019s Way\" Without Realizing** \u2013 This adds extra oil, salt, and spices, increasing calories and sodium.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips for Long-Term Success\n\n### **1. Plan Ahead**\nCheck the nutrition guide online before you go. Decide on your order in advance to avoid impulsive choices.\n\n### **2. Customize Without Guilt**\nMost Jersey Mike\u2019s locations are happy to accommodate requests. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for:\n- **\"No salt\"** on meats\n- **\"Extra veggies, light on cheese\"**\n- **\"Sauce on the side\"**\n\n### **3.

Make It a \"Sometimes\" Treat**\nEven the healthiest Jersey Mike\u2019s sub is still processed food. Enjoy it as an occasional meal, not a daily habit.\n\n### **5. Focus on Whole Foods the Rest of the Day**\nIf you\u2019re eating out, balance your day with:\n- A **veggie-packed breakfast** (e.g., omelet with spinach and mushrooms)\n- A **light dinner** (e.g., grilled fish with roasted vegetables)\n\n### **6.
