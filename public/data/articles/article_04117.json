Clara had always been fascinated by the human body and its secrets. While her friends spent their afternoons shopping or scrolling through social media, Clara immersed herself in books about anatomy and health. One day, while researching the liver, she stumbled upon a question that intrigued her: *What does a healthy human liver look like?*\n\nClara's quest for knowledge began with a simple Google search.
