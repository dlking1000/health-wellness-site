Opt for a medium-loft pillow that supports your neck without causing it to bend excessively.\n\n#### Support Your Lower Back\n\nPlace a small pillow or rolled towel under your knees.

A medium-firm mattress is typically recommended for back sleepers.\n\n#### Keep Your Head Elevated Slightly\n\nElevating your head slightly can help with breathing and reduce the likelihood of snoring. A wedge pillow can be particularly effective for this.\n\n### FAQ 3: How Can I Transition to Sleeping on My Back?\n\nIf you are used to sleeping on your side or stomach, transitioning to back sleeping may take some time.

Consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n#### Discomfort\n\nIf you experience discomfort while sleeping on your back, reassess your pillow and mattress.
