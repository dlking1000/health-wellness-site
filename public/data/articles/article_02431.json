Infection: Bacterial or fungal infections, such as candidiasis (yeast infection), can cause inflammation of the foreskin.\n3. Allergic reactions: Certain products or materials, such as latex condoms or certain soaps and lotions, can trigger an allergic reaction and lead to inflammation.\n4. Skin conditions: Underlying skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis, can also contribute to foreskin inflammation.\n5.

Apply topical treatments: Your healthcare provider may prescribe topical creams or ointments, such as antifungal or corticosteroid medications, to reduce inflammation and treat the underlying cause.\n3.
