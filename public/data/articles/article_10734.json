In this article, we will address frequently asked questions about energy gels, their benefits, usage, and considerations to help you make informed decisions for your health and performance.\n\n### What Are Energy Gels?\n\nEnergy gels are carbohydrate-rich supplements designed to provide quick and easily digestible energy during physical activities, especially endurance sports like running, cycling, and triathlons.

This facilitates digestion and absorption, reducing the risk of gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\n3. **Testing:** Prior to race day, try different brands and flavors during training sessions to identify which ones work best for you.

Avoid those loaded with artificial sweeteners or additives.\n\n2. **Carbohydrate Content:** Aim for gels containing 20-30 grams of carbohydrates per serving for optimal energy replenishment.\n\n3. **Caffeine Levels:** If you opt for caffeine-infused gels, check the dosage.
