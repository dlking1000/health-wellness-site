These live microorganisms, often referred to as \"good\" or \"friendly\" bacteria, can provide numerous health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts.[^1^]\n\nWhile probiotics are often associated with digestive health, emerging research suggests a connection between gut health and skin health, known as the gut-skin axis. In this complete guide, we will explore the potential benefits of probiotics for both digestive and skin health, as well as how to choose the right supplement for you.\n\n### What are Probiotics?\n\nProbiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are beneficial for health, particularly the digestive system. They are naturally found in fermented foods, such as yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi, as well as in dietary supplements.\n\nThere are many different strains of probiotics, each with its own unique set of potential health benefits. The most commonly used strains in supplements include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.[^2^]\n\n### The Gut-Skin Axis: Understanding the Connection\n\nEmerging research has suggested a connection between the gut and the skin, known as the gut-skin axis. This connection is thought to be mediated by the microbiome, the community of microorganisms that live on and inside the human body.\n\nStudies have shown that an imbalance in the gut microbiome, known as dysbiosis, can lead to inflammation and skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, and eczema. By restoring balance to the gut microbiome, probiotics may help improve skin health.[^3^]\n\n### Potential Benefits of Probiotics for Digestive Health\n\nProbiotics have long been associated with digestive health. Some potential benefits of probiotics for digestive health include:\n\n- Improving gut health by increasing the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut\n- Reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), such as bloating, gas, and abdominal pain\n- Preventing and treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea\n- Reducing the risk of certain digestive conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n\n### Potential Benefits of Probiotics for Skin Health\n\nIn addition to their potential benefits for digestive health, probiotics may also be beneficial for skin health. Some potential benefits of probiotics for skin health include:\n\n- Reducing inflammation and redness in the skin\n- Improving the skin barrier function, which helps to protect the skin from environmental stressors\n- Reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles\n- Improving acne and rosacea\n- Reducing the risk of certain skin conditions, such as eczema\n\n### How to Choose the Right Probiotic Supplement\n\nWhen choosing a probiotic supplement, it is important to consider a few key factors, including:\n\n- The strain of probiotics: Different strains of probiotics have different potential health benefits. Make sure to choose a supplement that contains strains that have been shown to be beneficial for your specific needs.\n- The number of live organisms: The number of live organisms in a probiotic supplement is measured in colony-forming units (CFUs). Look for a supplement that contains at least 1 billion CFUs.\n- The delivery system: Some probiotics are more sensitive to stomach acid and may not survive the journey to the gut. Look for a supplement that uses a delivery system, such as microencapsulation, to protect the live organisms.\n- Safety and quality: Make sure to choose a supplement that has been tested for safety and quality. Look for supplements that have been third-party tested and have a Certificate of Analysis (COA).\n\n### Product Recommendations\n\nMany people find that probiotic supplements can be helpful.
