However, many people can manage their cholesterol levels through lifestyle changes and dietary adjustments.

Higher levels of HDL can reduce your risk of heart disease.\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate Your Diet\n\nYour diet plays a crucial role in managing cholesterol levels.

Aim for at least 30 minutes most days.\n- **Strength Training**: Incorporate strength training exercises at least two days a week to build muscle mass.\n\n### Step 4: Limit Alcohol Intake\n\nModerate alcohol consumption may raise HDL cholesterol levels, but excessive drinking can lead to serious health issues.\n\n#### Guidelines for Alcohol Consumption\n\n- **Moderation is Key**: If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation\u2014up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: If you have high cholesterol or other health concerns, consult your healthcare provider about alcohol consumption.\n\n### Step 5: Consider Supplements\n\nCertain supplements may help lower cholesterol levels.
