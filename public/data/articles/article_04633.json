Aim to consume a variety of whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. This balanced approach will maximize the benefits of both your diet and supplements.\n\n#### 4. Stay Hydrated\n\nStaying hydrated is crucial when taking vitamins. Water aids in the absorption of nutrients and helps the body flush out toxins. Aim to drink enough water throughout the day to support overall health.\n\n#### 5. Monitor Your Body's Response\n\nEveryone's body is different. Pay attention to how you feel after starting Vitamins XL. If you notice any adverse effects, consult with a healthcare provider to determine if adjustments are needed.\n\n#### 6.
