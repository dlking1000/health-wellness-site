Eggs, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish can significantly improve nail strength and appearance.\n\n#### Day 3: Avoid Processed Foods\n\nMinimize the intake of processed foods and sugars, which can lead to inflammation and weaken your nails.

Your nails will thank you!\n\n#### Day 7: Reflect on Your Progress\n\nTake some time to assess how you feel after a week of better nutrition and hydration.
