Stick to the chosen approach and routine.\n2. **Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment**: Ensure the child's sleep area is dark, quiet, and comfortable. Consider using white noise machines or blackout curtains.\n3. **Establish a Bedtime Routine**: A consistent routine helps signal to your child that it is time to wind down and prepare for sleep.\n4. **Monitor Sleep Cues**: Pay attention to signs of sleepiness such as yawning, rubbing eyes, or fussiness.
