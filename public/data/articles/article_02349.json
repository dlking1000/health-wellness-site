This can cause symptoms like redness, swelling, heat, and pain.\n\nAcute inflammation is a normal and necessary part of the healing process. However, chronic inflammation, which persists for long periods of time, can be detrimental to your health. Chronic inflammation has been linked to a wide range of conditions, including:\n\n- Arthritis and joint pain\n- Cardiovascular disease\n- Diabetes\n- Cancer\n- Alzheimer's disease\n- Autoimmune disorders\n\nThe good news is that there are steps you can take to reduce inflammation and support your overall health.\n\n### Identifying Inflammation Triggers\n\nThe first step in effectively detoxing inflammation is to identify the potential triggers in your life.
