However, with the right lifestyle changes and commitment, you can take control of your blood pressure. This 30-day challenge is designed to help you achieve better blood pressure management through simple yet effective habits. \n\n### Understanding Blood Pressure\n\nBefore diving into the challenge, it is important to understand what blood pressure is and how it affects your health. Blood pressure measures the force of blood against the walls of your arteries. It is expressed in two numbers: systolic pressure (the pressure when your heart beats) over diastolic pressure (the pressure when your heart rests between beats). Normal blood pressure is typically around 120/80 mmHg. \n\nWhen blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mmHg, it is considered elevated or hypertensive. Hypertension can lead to heart disease, stroke, and other serious health issues. \n\n### Setting Your Goals\n\nAs you embark on this 30-day challenge, it is essential to set clear and achievable goals. Here are some goals to consider:\n\n- Reduce sodium intake\n- Increase physical activity\n- Manage stress levels\n- Maintain a healthy weight\n- Monitor blood pressure regularly\n\n### Week 1: Nutrition Overhaul\n\n#### Day 1: Assess Your Diet\n\nBegin your challenge by evaluating your current eating habits.
