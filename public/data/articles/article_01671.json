The nervous system is responsible for controlling and coordinating our body's functions, from breathing and digestion to movement and thought. When we experience stress, our nervous system goes into \"fight or flight\" mode, releasing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to prepare us for immediate action. While this response can be helpful in short-term situations, prolonged exposure to stress can lead to a host of health problems, including anxiety, depression, and even chronic pain.\n\nIn this comprehensive how-to guide, we will explore the impact of stress on the nervous system and provide practical steps to manage and reduce stress.
